One provocative new frontier in robotics, motivated by a convergenceof demographic, economic, cultural, and institutional pressures, is the developmentof\u201ccarebots \u201d\u2014robots intended to assist or replace human caregivers in the practice\nof caring for vulnerable persons such as the elderly, young, sick, or disabled. I argue\nhere that existing philosophical reflections on the ethical implications of carebots\nneglect a critical dimension of the issue: namely, the potential moral value ofcaregiving practices for caregivers . This value, I argue, gives rise to considerations\nthat must be weighed alongside consideration of the likely impact of carebots oncare recipients. Focusing on the goods internal to caring practices, I then examinethe potential impact of carebots on caregivers by means of three complementaryethical approaches: virtue ethics ,care ethics , and the capabilities approach . Each of\nthese, I argue, sheds new light on the contexts in which carebots might deprive\npotential caregivers of important moral goods central to caring practices, as well as\nthose contexts in which carebots might help caregivers sustain or even enrich thosepractices, and their attendant goods.\nKeywords Carebots .Capabilities .Virtue ethics .Care ethics\n1 Background\nIn the early twenty-first century, we stand on the threshold of welcoming robots into\ndomains of human activity that will expand their presence in our lives dramatically,extending well beyond the primarily industrial contexts in which robots have fordecades already been working alongside or in the place of human beings.

Of particularconcern to many are the ethical implications of what have been termed \u201ccarebots \u201d.\nCarebots are robots designed for use in home, hospital, or other settings to assist in,support, or provide care for sick, disabled, young, elderly, or otherwise vulnerablepersons. The kind of support they may provide varies widely, but generallyfollowing Sharkey and Sharkey ( 2010 ), we can distinguish between the following\nactual or potential functions of carebots: performing or providing assistance in\ncaregiving tasks; monitoring the health or behavioral status of those receiving care orthe provision of care by caregivers; and providing companionship to those undercare.\nMotivations for the development of carebots are various, but include demographic\npressures in countries like Japan, Germany, and the USA to ensure the ability to carefor a rapidly expanding population of aged or otherwise vulnerable persons,economic pressures upon individuals, private or public institutions to reduce the\ncosts of care, social pressures to reduce growing institutional failures to provide\nquality human care, and recognition of the need to reduce the often-overwhelmingphysical and psychological burdens placed upon individual caregivers.\nDevelopment and implementation of carebots is in a relatively early stage. A few\nlimited applications have found some initial success \u2014AIST \u2019s Paro Therapeutic\nRobot, a bionic fur-covered harp seal, was recently classified in the USA as a Class2 medical device used to provide companionship in nursing home settings, and hasbeen widely used in Denmark (Tergesen and Inada 2010 ). Most carebots are still in\nthe development stage, though some are relatively advanced along that path \u2014\nincluding the RIBA nurse robot developed by Japan \u2019s RIKEN-TRI Collaboration\nCenter for Human-Interactive Robot Research (RTC). RIBA, already a secondgeneration upgrade to the earlier RI-MAN, can lift a patient from a bed to awheelchair, and vice versa.\n4GeckoSystems International Corporation is currently\nconducting limited in-home trials of its CareBot. Combining a mobile-service robotbase with interlinked AI modules for navigation, tracking, scheduling, and reminders(e.g., medications, food, etc.), and even verbal interaction ( \u201cchat\u201d), the CareBot is\ndescribed in GeckoSystems \u2019marketing as having a commercial potential that\nincludes both elder care and child care.\n5Indeed, while it may be quite some time\n1The most well-known of these is the daVinci Surgical System manufactured and marketed by Intuitive\nSurgical, Inc., but others include Medsys \u2019LapMan and Titan Medical Inc. \u2019s Amadeus.\n2See Singer ( 2009 ) for an excellent discussion of emerging military robotics and their implications.\n3Consider as examples iRobot \u2019s popular Roomba, Friendly Robotics \u2019Robomower, Sony \u2019s AIBO, and\nMeccano \u2019s Spykee.\n4http://www.ribarobotnurse.com/ , accessed 5 Jan 2011.\n5http://www.geckosystems.com/markets/consumer_familycare.php , accessed 5 Jan 2011.252 S.

While we would expectcarebot developers to offer generous, even unrealistic predictions of the role of such\ntechnologies in the future, the roadmap from which they are working is quite\nexplicit, as indicated on the placeholder marketing site for RIBA, which has alreadysecured its commercial domain name: \u201cThere might come a time when human\ncaregivers will be replaced by robots. An impossible vision it may seem, but do notbe too surprised about human caregivers being assisted by robots in the nearfuture. \u201d\n6\n2 Carebots and Ethics\nPronouncements of the latter sort understandably set off philosophical alarms about\nthe ethical dangers of \u201creplacing \u201dhuman caregivers with machines. We might\nreasonably regard such statements as commercial hyperbole, yet even the morerealistic near-term scenarios for carebots supply ample motivation for ethicalreflection and inquiry. What are the various sorts of ethical concerns we mightlegitimately have? For methodological purposes, let us set aside important questions\nabout the practicality of the grander technological aims of carebot researchers and\ndevelopers. Let us also set aside well-motivated worries about the safety of suchtechnologies should they be introduced. In the absence of a significant collapse ofexisting social mechanisms for assuring medical product safety (mechanisms whichone must grant, are far from perfect), let us assume for the sake of argument thatgrave and widespread safety issues can be prevented. There are still a large numberof issues that remain.\nMark Coeckelbergh ( 2009 ) has helpfully separated what he calls questions of\n\u201croboethics \u201dinto several categories. The first category pertains to the minds and\nrealities of robots themselves (in this category we would place concerns aboutwhether artificially intelligent robots could ever properly be considered moralagents, whether they might have \u201crights \u201d, whether they could relate to human beings\nin ethically significant ways, and so on). The second category pertains to theapplication of traditional ethical theories to human \u2013robot interactions, allowing us to\njudge their ethical significance (in this category we might place worries aboutwhether our filial obligations to the elderly can be satisfied through quality care\nprovided by robots, or whether the use of carebots is sufficiently warranted by their\ncollective social utility). Coeckelbergh wishes to redirect our ethical inquiry to anew, third manner of reflection \u2014by moving away from the application of what he\ncalls \u201cexternal \u201dethical criteria, and toward consideration of the \u201cgood internal to\npractice \u201dthat may be realized through robot \u2013human interaction (217). That is, he\nwishes to consider how we experience such interactions, and what they \u201cdo to us as\nsocial and emotional beings \u201d(219).\n6http://www.ribarobotnurse.com/ , accessed 5 Jan 2011.Carebots and Caregivers 253", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f6f6cb8-bccd-4fe8-86e6-6cd308a921d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f6f6cb8-bccd-4fe8-86e6-6cd308a921d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "254", "file_name": "paper.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aefa84f6-19b8-45b2-8810-026740544852", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "254", "file_name": "paper.pdf"}, "hash": "f69709ddc46be86ec351711f67e5885ac68517aa2a82b0a711a08aa9cc933cd3"}}, "hash": "f69709ddc46be86ec351711f67e5885ac68517aa2a82b0a711a08aa9cc933cd3", "text": "This, too, is my concern.

Though only a handful of scholars haveyet turned their attention to this subject, many of the most important ethical issues\nhave been carefully discussed in the existing philosophical literature on carebots. Of\ncourse, there remain substantive disagreements about how to evaluate the moral risksand benefits of introducing carebots into actual care settings. In general, thesedisagreements involve conflicting judgments about whether carebots will improve ordegrade the quality of life of the cared-fors, whether they will improve or degraderelations between cared-fors and caregivers, and whether will they will result in animprovement or degradation of personal and institutional quality of care provision.\nSpecifically, concerns have been raised about:\n1. The objectification of the elderly as \u201cproblems \u201dto be solved by technological\nmeans (Sparrow & Sparrow 2006 , 143; Sharkey & Sharkey 2010 ).\n2. The potential for carebots to either enhance or restrict the capabilities ,freedom ,\nautonomy , and/or dignity of cared-fors (Borenstein & Pearson 2010 ; Sharkey &\nSharkey 2010 ; Decker 2008 ).\n3. The potential of carebots to enhance or reduce engagement of cared-fors with\ntheir surroundings (Borenstein & Pearson 2010 ; Sharkey & Sharkey 2010 ).\n4. The potential of carebots to enhance or intrude upon the privacy of cared-fors\n(Sharkey & Sharkey 2010 ).\n5. The quality of physical and psychological care robots can realistically be\nexpected to supply (Coeckelbergh 2010 ; Sparrow & Sparrow 2006 ).\n6. The potential of carebots to either reduce or enhance cared-fors \u2019levels of human\ncontact with families and other human caregivers (Sparrow & Sparrow 2006 ).\n7. The potential of carebot relations to be inherently deceptive orinfantilizing\n(Sparrow & Sparrow 2006 ; Sharkey & Sharkey 2010 ; Turkle 2006 ).\nAll of these concerns are well motivated and demanding of further study.\nSomething has been left out of all of these treatments, however. Though muchattention has deservedly been paid to the impact of carebots on those cared for, thatis, how well cared-for humans will be in a scenario where carebots are employed,less attention has been paid to their impact on caregivers and society more broadly.\nWhere this does get addressed, it is typically limited to a focus on the way in whichcarebots may help to \u201creduce the care burden \u201don caregivers and on society (Sharkey\n& Sharkey 2010 ), empowering people to make caregiving a choice rather than an\nobligation (Borenstein & Pearson 2010 , 283\u20134), allowing caregivers to trade routine\ntasks for more emotionally meaningful ones (Coeckelbergh 2010\n, 183), and\neliminating or reducing the numbers of undercompensated, overworked, and ill-trained human caregivers, especially in institutional settings (Coeckelbergh 2010 ,\n183; Borenstein & Pearson 2010 , 285). However, I will show that by ignoring the\npositive value of caring practices for caregivers, current scholarly reflections on the\nethical implications of carebots remain dangerously one-sided. I then examine thevalue of caring practices for caregivers through the conceptual lenses of three\ncomplementary ethical frameworks, each of which are oriented toward the goods254 S.

It is also quite clear toanyone who has spent much time in a skilled nursing facility or other comparableinstitutional setting that as Borenstein and Pearson note, \u201c\u2026it is difficult to support\nthe notion that current caregiving conditions ought to be preserved \u201d(2010 , 286).\nSurrendering caring practices to robots might be risky or ethically worrisome, but so\nis maintaining the status quo. So before proceeding, let me stipulate that carebots,properly designed and implemented, might be able to improve the lives of bothcared-fors and caregivers in ways that would be ethically desirable and, in theabsence of acceptable alternatives, ethically mandated.\nStill, it deeply concerns me that there has been virtually no scholarly discussion of\nwhat value caregiving, as a human practice, might have for caregivers rather than\ncared-fors, what the ethical significance of that value might be, and how the value of\nsuch caring practices might be impacted by the widespread introduction of carebots.\nTo the contrary, the standing assumption seems to be that caregiving is generally notonly a burden upon caregivers (which we can grant) but that it is nothing except a\nburden. Again and again it is described only as a \u201crequirement \u201d, a social\n\u201cexpectation \u201d, a burden people (especially women) are forced to bear (Borenstein\n&P e a r s o n 2010 , 284; Sharkey & Sharkey 2010 ). Even the provision of\ncompanionship and emotional support is characterized as a \u201ctask\u201d(Sparrow &\nSparrow 2006 ). Nussbaum ( 2006 ) rightly notes that contemporary societies still tend\nto assume women will give care \u201cfor free, \u2018out of love, \u2019\u201d(102), her use of scare\nquotes redirecting us to the image of caregiving as an unfair burden. Yet if there arenofurther dimensions to caregiving practices, it would seem to follow that in the\nabsence of consequent injury or moral insult to cared-fors , we could have no reason\nto hesitate to surrender our caregiving practices to carebots, and to encourage othersto do the same.\n7\nIntuitively, it seems this cannot be right, and despite the fact that their concerns\nabout carebots tend to focus exclusively on potential harms to cared-fors, I doubt\n(though I could be mistaken) that many of the philosophers who have reflected on\nthe ethics of robot care would endorse the above conclusion. Nevertheless, it begsthe question why the potential losses to caregivers who surrender such practices havenot been explicitly considered. Of course, it is acknowledged that caregiving may be\n7The only way to avoid this conclusion, beyond the one I suggest, is to presuppose a deontological\nframework, perhaps of a Kantian sort, that entails individual moral obligations to provide care anddictates\nthat we may not employ indirect technological means of meeting these obligations. I am not optimistic,\nhowever, about the viability of such a claim.Carebots and Caregivers 255", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbcfa637-87e1-450b-bb14-0141cbfa8b16": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbcfa637-87e1-450b-bb14-0141cbfa8b16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "256", "file_name": "paper.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a0f6f59-26ff-4e54-bbaa-95bc0fd7bcb5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "256", "file_name": "paper.pdf"}, "hash": "38e1b547bad5971f5c01bc6e4a078b9bf083c0dc834e7f80acd47b03c0a9284f"}}, "hash": "38e1b547bad5971f5c01bc6e4a078b9bf083c0dc834e7f80acd47b03c0a9284f", "text": "freely chosen, indeed, this is presented as the ideal state of affairs. Borenstein and\nPearson, following Nussbaum ( 2006 ), tell us that \u201cthose who provide care in non-\nemergency contexts should have the freedom to choose the extent, type, and mannerof caregiving \u201d(2010 , 284). But the reasons why one might choose to give care are\nnot explored, and these reasons matter a great deal to our inquiry.\nSome such choices might be motivated by a kind of ethical heroism, a willingness\nto take on burdens of care so that others do not have to. Others might be motivated\nby a sense of personal and non-transferrable duty, such that one would rather sufferthe burdens of giving care than the guilt of shirking them. Still others might bemotivated by external rewards that outweigh the burdens of care, such as monetarycompensation, or expressions of gratitude and admiration by cared-fors andobservers. But all of these reasons presuppose that the caregiving practice itself is\nsimply a burden, the free acceptance of which must be justified by somethingexternal to the practice. If this is right, then it would appear that nearly all of the\nexternal conditions that warrant freely giving care could potentially be eliminated\nwith the introduction of carebots \u2014by transferring caring tasks to entities that cannot\nexperience them asa burden. Yet I wish to propose another possibility: that there are\ngoods internal to the practice of caregiving that we might not wish to surrender, orthat it might be unwise to surrender even if we might often wish to do so.\nIn our methodology, then, we return to the orientation of Coeckebergh ( 2009 ),\nwho we should recall, wishes to redirect our inquiry away from \u201cexternal \u201dethical\ncriteria, and toward the \u201cgood internal to practice \u201d(217) that may be realized\nthrough robot \u2013human interactions. He thinks we should think more deeply about\nhow we experience such interactions with robots, and what they \u201cdo to us as social\nand emotional beings \u201d(219). I agree. But Coeckelbergh \u2019s interest here is narrower\nthan mine. It is what the robots do to us that captures his interest, and here he refers\nto the way in which their \u201cappearances \u201dto us, regardless of the inner realities of\nrobot \u201cminds \u201d, can powerfully shape our own perceptions, emotions, and capabilities\n(219\u2013220). I think this is a question of tremendous ethical importance. Yet if we\napply it to the carebot question, it targets, once again, the impact of carebots on those\nto whom they primarily appear, namely those cared for. Of course, they may interact\nwith human caregivers in the environment too \u2014nursing staff, family members, and\nso on. But if we focus narrowly on what the robots do to us through theirappearances to us, we leave behind the question of what we may do to ourselves\nwhen we choose to surrender caring practices to robots. If there are goods internal tothe practice of caring, then I am surrendering these goods if I give up the practice,and this holds true whether or not I have interactions with the robot to whom I havesurrendered it.\n8\nWhat kind of goods could these be? There are at least three philosophical\nperspectives that fit well with our methodology and might help us conceptualize thenature of these goods. They are (1) a virtue ethics approach, (2) a care ethics\napproach, and (3) a capabilities approach. Each of these philosophical perspectives\n8It is of course possible that caregivers might choose to share caring practices with robots rather than\nsurrender them, as I will note. However, given the widespread acknowledgment of the burdens of giving\ncare, we cannot discount the possibility that many potential caregivers will, once they trust the safety and\nskill of carebots, transfer significant caring duties to them.256 S.

Second, I believe at this early stage of inquiry it is more important to\nilluminate the subject matter as richly as possible than to identify with precision the\nconceptual framework most appropriate to it.\n4 Carebots and the Virtues\nThe virtues are conventionally understood as dispositional states of character that\ncan be regarded as excellent, insofar as they promote human flourishing. I have\nspoken elsewhere (Vallor 2010 ) of the way in which a contemporary account of the\nvirtues can help us evaluate the moral significance of emerging informationtechnologies. Rather than rehearse those arguments here, I would like simply to outlinetwo important moral virtues that arguably rely upon caregiving practices for theirdevelopment: reciprocity and empathy . These are hardly the only important moral\nvirtues cultivated in caregiving practices \u2014we might mention also patience, under-\nstanding, and charity, to name just a few. But the virtues I discuss below are sufficientto illustrate the larger points I wish to make \u2014(1) that there are important goods for\ncaregivers that are internal to caregiving practices, and that (2) the potential impact on\nthese from the widespread use of carebots merits our careful attention. FollowingCoeckelbergh \u2019s(2009 ) invocation of a neo-Aristotelian way of thinking about\nroboethics, one that focuses on the \u201ckind of moral habits and moral character we\nshould develop, \u201d(220) let us investigate the way in which caregiving practices help to\nshape the moral character of caregivers, and the attendant ethical value that may giveus reason to pause at the thought of transferring such practices to carebots.\n4.1 Reciprocity\nI have defined reciprocity elsewhere (Vallor 2011 ) as a primitive biological impulse\nwhich functions as the seed of human sociality, is the unifying feature of all forms offriendship and, with proper moral and cognitive/perceptual habituation, matures intoa social virtue. The basic sociality of human beings is non-controversial. Despite ourvulnerability to organic pathologies of reciprocity, such as autism, under normalconditions the human person is fundamentally oriented to others. Reciprocity\n(antipeponthos ) is also at the core of Aristotle \u2019s understanding of ethical relations,\nboth in its intimate and civic forms ( 1984 , NE 1155b34); human persons, he\nbelieves, are naturally predisposed to social give and take ( 1984 , NE 1155a).\nBut reciprocity is more than a natural impulse \u2014it is also something we must\ncultivate as a virtue \u2014for understanding how to reciprocate well, in the right ways, at\nthe right times, and as appropriate to particular circumstances and people, is part ofwhat it means to become a good person. Even Aristotle \u2019s notoriously inegalitarian\naccounts of unequal friendships and marriage, whatever their substantive errors, are\nmeditations on reciprocity and how to ensure that human bonds are not destroyed byCarebots and Caregivers 257", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a9a93c0-13dc-4a24-a084-8c1c820a2397": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a9a93c0-13dc-4a24-a084-8c1c820a2397", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "258", "file_name": "paper.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8ad4da2f-0ef3-4f91-b52c-3739c68a0e43", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "258", "file_name": "paper.pdf"}, "hash": "a63a74dd12a286c167bee15b159ba63768f7ce803ad38d0ea06c5dc01dca8a91"}}, "hash": "a63a74dd12a286c167bee15b159ba63768f7ce803ad38d0ea06c5dc01dca8a91", "text": "one member of a pair \u2019s inability to give benefits as well as receive them. It is the\nethical maturation of reciprocity to which Aristotle refers when he claims thatbetween friends, there is no need of justice ( 1984 , NE 1155a26); for justice is a\npreventative and remedy for breakdowns and gaps in reciprocity; between completefriends of virtue, then, justice is a cure without a disease.\nLawrence Becker ( 1986 ) has asserted that reciprocity is in fact among the most\nfundamental virtues, one that is essential to creating and sustaining the primary\ngoods that allow human lives to flourish (146 \u2013150). This further entails, according\nto Becker, an ethical obligation on our part to maintain social structures thatperpetuate reciprocity as a virtue, and to modify social structures that damage it(163). This claim, if true, reinforces the need to consider the potential impact of theintroduction of carebots on the human cultivation of reciprocity. For it is evident thatreciprocity is cultivated, among other human contexts, in caregiving practices. Thismay not be immediately evident if we restrict our attention to the asymmetry\nbetween the vulnerable cared-for who receives care, and the one who gives it. Yet let\nus remember that the elderly parents we hand-feed once fed us, that the sister whoseradiation sickness we comfort perhaps nursed us through a childhood flu, and evenin institutional settings that nurses, doctors, and therapists are themselves, at times,the patients. We learn in our times of need that others are there for us, and as I wishto stress, we may learn in being there for others to trust that someday, others will bethere for us. We also learn the importance of giving for the development of our ownmoral character, the way it facilitates other virtues, such as patience, empathy, and\nunderstanding. We learn in caregiving practices to see how reciprocity holds human\nrelations together and allows other kinds of goods to flow across them. To surrendercaregiving practices then, even if we stipulate that we will surrender them only to\nrobots who can give what the other truly needs \u2014potentially deprives us of an\nimportant opportunity to cultivate reciprocity in ourselves, and to understand itscentrality to human bonds.\n4.2 Empathy\nI have defined this elsewhere (Vallor 2011 ) as an emotive/perceptual capacity that,\nlike reciprocity, develops in most humans from a basic biological impulse, expressesitself fully in the highest forms of friendship, and, when properly cultivated andexpressed, constitutes a virtue. Though Aristotle did not himself consider empathy avirtue ( 1984 , NE 1106a4), I have claimed ( 2011 ) that it occupies a critical role in the\nlife of virtue Aristotle describes and that Aristotle would likely himself have\nrecognized it as a proper virtue had he enjoyed a better understanding of the\nintegration of emotion and reason in human persons, as well as the essential nature\nof human vulnerability in grounding ethical human relations.\nEmpathy is an emotive/perceptual capacity to feel with another sentient being, to\nco-experience, in a significant way, the joys and sufferings of another. In empathy,one \u201cgrieves and rejoices with ( sunalgounta kai sunchaironta )\u201danother human\nbeing ( 1984 , NE 1166a8). When cultivated as a virtue, it manifests itself as ability to\nreceive such feelings in the appropriate sorts of circumstances and relationships, andto respond to the other in a manner that is also highly attuned and appropriate to\nthese particulars.258 S.

Thelatter relation, unlike the former, involves a genuine intensity of feeling ( 1984 ,N E\n1166b34). Aristotle says that with those for whom we have goodwill, we wish themwell but \u201cwe would not doanything with them \u201d(1984 , NE 1167a2) \u201cnor take\ntrouble for them \u201d(1984 , NE 1167a10). I wish to focus on the latter claim as\nsignificant. Though Aristotle certainly did n ot describe empathetic relations taking\nplace in the contexts we currently associate with caregiving practices \u2014he would\nview these as almost exclusively feminine practices alien to the masculine ethicalideal he attempts to cultivate \u2014a virtue ethical perspective that applied appropriate\ncorrectives to his narrowly gendered ideal can take this last remark as suggestive.For those with whom I empathize, I will indeed \u201ctake trouble, \u201dand this occurs most\nnotably in caring relations. In caregiving practices I take upon myself the trouble ofrecognizing, acknowledging, feeling, and responding appropriately to the suffering\nof another.\nSparrow and Sparrow ( 2006 ) stress the importance of empathy in caregiving as a\nmeans of showing the irreplaceability of human caregivers by carebots, claiming that\u201centities which do not understand the facts about human experience and mortality\nthat make tears appropriate will be unable to fulfill this caring role \u201d(154). I do not\ndispute this claim, but I wish to stress a different implication. It is primarily infulfilling these caring roles that humans learn to practice and cultivate empathy as avirtue, and without such opportunities, the development of this virtue may be\nsignificantly impeded. For most of us, empathy is a quivering flame constantly\nvulnerable to being extinguished by apathy or cynicism, or our natural desire toprotect ourselves from suffering. Many choose, often regrettably, to turn away fromcircumstances that might provoke an empathic response, and caregiving contexts,especially those that involve our physical presence to suffering, rank very highlyamong such circumstances. The concern, then, is that the availability of carebots as asubstitute for human care may be very appealing to those who have not yet becomecomfortable with the cultivation of empathy in caregiving practices, leading them to\nabandon or greatly limit their exposure to such practices. As Sharkey and Sharkey\n(2010 ) note, the possibility of having a robot provide care, or offer a way to supply\nmore remote forms of care, may allow us to feel that we are satisfying our caringobligations even when not present to suffering. I suggest that this is not only apotential loss to the cared-for, but to the caregiver.\nWhen caregiving becomes a practice, and when this practice is done well,w e\nbecome more accustomed to, even welcoming of, the emotional weight of empathy.Gradually, we may learn how to be restored rather than drained by sharing feeling.\nWe can find solidarity in it \u2014as Sparrow and Sparrow ( 2006 ) note, \u201cSometimes the\nonly appropriate response to another \u2019s suffering is the acknowledgment that we too\nshare these frailties, as for instance, when our friend \u2019s suffering moves us to tears \u201d\n(154). It must be noted, however, that this is only possible when caregivers havesufficient resources and support for such practices \u2014as we will emphasize below,\ncaregiving in inadequate circumstances is likely to drain us of emotional power andstarve empathic responses rather than cultivate them. As Borenstein and Pearson(2010 ) note, \u201cmerely because a human is assigned the task of providing care, an\nemotional bond does not necessarily form \u201d(285).

If the availability of robot care seduces usinto abandoning caregiving practices before we have had sufficient opportunities tocultivate the virtues of empathy and reciprocity, among others, the impact upon our\nmoral character, and society, could be quite devastating. On the other hand, if\ncarebots provide forms of limited support that draw us further into caregiving\npractices, able to feel more and give more, freed from the fear that we will becrushed by unbearable burdens, then the moral effect on the character of caregiverscould be remarkably positive.\n5 Carebots and the Ethics of Care\nCare ethics has been developed by a number of different feminist thinkers, including\nGilligan ( 1982 ), Noddings ( 1984 ), Kittay ( 1999 ), and Held ( 2006 ). Like virtue\nethics, care ethics takes its orientation from the goods internal to practices rather thanexternal moral criteria. Yet unlike virtue ethics, it focuses on caring practices, andcaring relations, as fundamental. Rather than holding the virtues themselves to beethical desiderata, care ethics takes virtue to be merely an outgrowth of the caringrelation that is the primary ethical good. And given its focus on caring relations and\npractices, we should expect to find in these perspectives important insights for the\nethical implications of carebots.\nFor reasons of space, I will confine myself here to examining the perspective of\nNoddings on the ethical significance of caregiving practices. Noddings ( 1984 )\nasserts that the caring relation is a first and foremost a natural one. Through ourmemories of being cared-for, we acquire our first and ultimate understanding of thegood. The natural caring relation functions as regulative in human social behavior,motivating us to seek to restore the relation when it becomes deficient or disrupted.\nFrom the natural caring relation, then, which in itself is not a moral one, we acquire\nan ethical ideal, a notion of the \u201cethical self \u201dthat comes to function as a commitment\nto meet the other, and in particular those within our intimate kinship circle, fromwithin the caring attitude. Importantly, Noddings notes that \u201cThis caring for self, for\ntheethical self , can emerge only from a caring for others \u201d(14). Thus while the\nmemory of being cared-for is required for the development of the ethical self as aregulative ideal, it is only through caring for others that I can care for that ideal \u2014\nonly through a commitment to caring practices can I ensure that my ethical self is\nsustained and enriched.\nNoddings identifies two central criteria for a genuinely caring commitment \u2014\nnamely, engrossment and motivational displacement (16). Engrossment is an\norientation to the reality of the other, as opposed to my own reality. It allows theneeds of the other to be foregrounded in my field of awareness, rather than as thebackground of my own needs and desires, as they stand outside the genuinely caringattitude. Motivational displacement is the resultant feeling that \u201cIm u s td o\nsomething \u201d(14), I must act to respond to the other \u2019s reality, \u201cto reduce the pain,\nto fill the need, to actualize the dream \u201d(14). These criteria, of course, create quite a260 S.

And yet, Noddings notes that in\nall caring situations, there is a risk that \u201cthe one-caring will be overwhelmed by the\nresponsibilities and duties of the task and that, as a result of being burdened, he or\nshe will cease to care for the othe r\u2026\u201d (12).\nShe also tells us that the ethical ideal sustained through caring for others is itself\nsubject to practical constraint (50). Since caring is concrete activity, I can only carewithin the limits of the possible, and a host of environmental, social, or institutionalconditions are among those that can constrain and impoverish my ethical ideal.When we think, then, about the unrealistic emotional and physical burdens often putupon caregivers in contemporary society, it is hard to deny that the ethical ideal is\nalready impoverished and constrained for many of us. Engrossment in the reality of\nthe other is not possible when I have had so little sleep that I am at the limits ofhuman capacity just to go through the routine motions of care \u2014changing the\nbedpan, remembering to give medication, cleaning the wound. What more can Igive? What reason can we have, then, to deny that the introduction of carebots insome contexts, and for some purposes, might be essential to sustaining the\ncaregivers, so that they need not face the degradation of their own moral being? Itis also worth noting that on Noddings \u2019view, caring relations need to be reciprocal if\ncaregivers are going to be sustained. That is, caregivers need some acknowledgment\nof the relation on the part of the cared-for, and though one can continue to care as anethical choice in the absence of such reciprocity, it is far more difficult to remainengrossed in responding to the reality of another who will not, or cannotacknowledge the value of your response. Can carebots help here? Borenstein andPearson ( 2010 ) note that by providing cared-fors with greater independence, their\nown capabilities to respond to caregivers may be enhanced, promoting a \u201ccare\nrecipient \u2019s ability to \u2018love those who love and care for us \u2019\u201d(282).\nConsider another scenario, however \u2014the one in which carebots appear to us as\nliberation from care rather than liberation tocare. We have seen the emphasis on the\nidea that care must be a choice, that the freedom and autonomy of potentialcaregivers is of paramount importance. This seems to presuppose, however, thatsome of us will choose notto give care, and that perhaps this choice ought not to be\nregarded as a bad thing, as long as there are carebot resources available to meet theneeds of cared-fors. As Noddings notes, we arefree to reject the impulse to care\n(51). We have other desires, and other needs with which caring practices compete.\nAnd if we are exhorted by carebot marketers or nursing home managers to \u201clet the\nrobot do its job \u201d, to surrender caring tasks to a being which will surely not forget a\npill, will not lose patience, will not let a loved one fall, we might be mistakenly ledto think that both we and our cared-for are best served by this surrender. YetNoddings is right, I think, that \u201cI enslave myself to a particularly unhappy task when\nI make this choice. As I chop away at the chains that bind me to loved others,\n9It is worth noting, with reference to our discussions of virtue above, that Noddings identifies\nengrossment with the capacity for empathy as \u201cfeeling with \u201d(30).Carebots and Caregivers 261", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78750618-47b3-41de-83fd-79c2b6f1f806": {"__data__": {"id_": "78750618-47b3-41de-83fd-79c2b6f1f806", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "262", "file_name": "paper.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fb58bf55-10f0-43f2-a308-0780fc31ef9b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "262", "file_name": "paper.pdf"}, "hash": "b12480160d5e9f2e49bd2f835c3d9e8f8f3d194ed975a3d40bd976deb65b62d3"}}, "hash": "b12480160d5e9f2e49bd2f835c3d9e8f8f3d194ed975a3d40bd976deb65b62d3", "text": "asserting my freedom, I move into a wilderness of strangers and loneliness, leaving\nbehind all who cared for me and even, perhaps, my own self \u201d(51).\nThus it is one thing to choose when to care, and for whom, and to ensure that I\nreceive the support I need in caring to sustain my self emotionally, physically, andmorally. Carebots might help us do better with all of this, and in the absence ofalternative solutions, it might be ethically necessary to employ them in certain\ncontexts. But how many of us be seduced by the possibility opened up by carebots\nofnotcaring, at least not in the sort of intimate, direct relations that presuppose\nengrossment in the reality of the suffering or vulnerable other? And how can weprotect ourselves against such a seduction unless we attend more carefully to theways in which engagement in caring practices is critical for our own well-being, andnot just that of those who need us?\n6 Carebots and Human Capabilities\nFinally, let us consider the capabilities approach. Capabilities approaches, rooted in\nthe economic and political philosophies of Sen ( 1999 ) and Nussbaum ( 2000 ,2006 ),\npresuppose that considerations of justice require attention to more than just theavailability and social distribution of various external goods, resources, or utilities.Rather, thinking about justice requires attention to basic human capabilities and/orfunctionings, understood as goods realized in human living through certain kinds of\nactivities and practices. As realization of these capabilities is critical to human\nflourishing, the requirements of justice demand that we not sacrifice their realizationby individuals merely in order to maximize overall utility. While the capabilitiesapproach was conceptualized to respond to deficiencies in other theories of justice(e.g., Rawls, utilitarianism), it can also be used more broadly in the context of ethics,in order to help us conceptualize the good life and the means of its realization.\nAnd in fact it is used by philosophers who weigh the ethical implications of\ncarebots \u2014Borenstein and Pearson ( 2010 , 278) employ this approach in order to\nshow that, for example, carebots might allow caregivers to meet their moral\nobligations without destroying their own emotional health (a loss that mightundermine, for example, their human capacities for love, play or friendship). Theyalso note that the capabilities approach helps us identify how carebots should notbe\nused\u2014for example, in ways that would deprive caregivers or cared-fors of control\nover their environment (279). Consider in this regard a carebot that secured thephysical well-being of nursing home patients by rigidly confining their movementsto prevent any risk of a fall \u2014leaving them socially isolated and deprived of\nautonomy. Coeckelbergh ( 2010 ) also references the capabilities approach as a model\nfor ethical reflection on carebots. Though he does not take the capabilities approachto be exhaustive of the moral issues at stake with carebots (186), he suggests we useit as one way to evaluate whether any given practice of caregiving qualifies as \u201cgood\ncare\u201d(185).\nI suggest we employ the capabilities approach in one further respect: to help us to\nconceptualize the goods internal to caring practices for caregivers , goods that might\nbe lost should a person choose to surrender some or all of such practices to a carebot.\nHow should we proceed?

The list identifies and defines the capabilities of life, bodily health, bodilyintegrity, sensation, imagination and thought, emotions, practical reason, affiliation,[relatedness to] other species, play, and control over one \u2019s environment (76 \u201377).\nWhile the goods internal to caring practices might be incorporated in all of these\ncapabilities, I wish to focus on just three, affiliation ,practical reason , and emotion ,\nwhich I will argue each represent capacities enhanced for caregivers within caring\npractices. Nussbaum describes these capacities as follows:\n6.1 Affiliation\n(Part A) \u201cBeing able to live with and toward others, to recognize and show\nconcern for other human beings, to engage in various forms of socialinteraction; to be able to imagine the situation of another. \u201d\nNussbaum ( 2006 , 77)\n6.2 Practical Reason\n\u201cBeing able to form a conception of the good and to engage in critical\nreflection about the planning of one \u2019s life. \u201d\nNussbaum ( 2006 , 77)\n6.3 Emotions\n\u201cBeing able to have attachments to things and people outside ourselves; to love\nthose who love and care for us, to grieve at their absence; in general, to love, to\ngrieve, to experience longing, gratitude and justified anger.

(Supporting this\ncapability means supporting forms of human association that can be shownto be crucial in their development). \u201d\nNussbaum ( 2006 ,7 6\u201377)\nI assert that caring practices, and more specifically, engagement in such practices\nin the role of caregiver as well as one cared-for , are critical for the development of\nthese capabilities, for both men and women. Let me begin with affiliation. Thecapability of affiliation described above entails the ability \u201cto recognize and show\nconcern for other human beings. \u201dHow do we develop this ability? What human\npractice is most critical here? I would argue that caregiving practices, while notexhaustive of those through which we develop the capacity of affiliation, areessential to its full development. Certainly I may show concern for the general\u201cother \u201dby means other than giving care \u2014for example, by giving money to charity,\nthrough social and political advocacy, or through throwing myself into intellectual\nand practical activities aimed at addressing important problems that others face.

Even as a child I come to this attitude through caring practices \u2014by looking\nafter a younger sibling, feeding and watering a pet, fetching Kleenex for a flu-afflicted parent, or patiently listening to the problems of a friend. It is through theseinteractions that I come to understand what human \u201caffiliation \u201dmeans, as a way of\nbeing with others that is responsive and mutually supportive. It is primarily throughrepeated concrete exposures to human need, and taking up the practice of responding\nto need with care, that I develop the abstractive capacity to \u201cimagine the situation of\nanother \u201doutside my own intimate circle of care.\nLet us next consider the cultivation of practical reason. Here caregiving also plays\na central role. First, it can be argued that no \u201cconception of the good \u201dis complete\nthat does not recognize caring relations as a basic human good.\n10That is to say, we\nwould regard a person as prudentially deficient whose deliberations about actionwere never informed by an appreciation for the goodness of one human caring foranother. Nussbaum herself tells us that we must appreciate \u201cthe importance of care\nas a social primary good \u201d(2006 , 2). Now, we might think that such an appreciation\ncould be acquired simply from the experience of being cared for, and that the\npractice of giving care, which I have emphasized, is inessential here. I reject this\nclaim, however, for reasons that should be apparent from the above considerations,and which will be reinforced by the discussion of emotional capability that follows.It is through giving care that I learn to recognize signs of need in another, that I\nbecome habituated to responding to need, and that I come to fully appreciate thegoodness of the caring role and the importance (and challenge) of caring well.A s\ncared forI can see the goodness of having my needs met \u2014but I do not fully grasp\nthe goodness of meeting needs until I have taken on that role myself and experiencedits challenges and rewards. Without engaging in caregiving practices my grasp of thegoodness of caring relations remains impoverished and one-sided.\nSecondly, it is at least in part through caregiving practices that I become capable\nof the prudent \u201cplanning of one \u2019s life \u201dthat Nussbaum speaks of. How can I possibly\nplan my life well unless I am aware of the vulnerabilities of sickness, injury, age, orother conditions of life to which I am, sooner or later, going to be exposed? Nor is a\nmerely intellectual grasp of these conditions sufficient for planning. It is not enough\nto know that I need, for example, health and disability insurance, or adequatesavings, or an advanced health care directive on file. I also need to plan for theemotional, physical, social challenges that these conditions may bring, to preparemyself through reflection and conversations with loved ones for how we cantogether bear those conditions with dignity and grace, if possible. And it is primarilythrough witnessing others go through those challenges, and more specifically,learning through caregiving practices how humans find, or lose, dignity in their\nvulnerability, that I become able to reflect deeply on how I might secure the dignity\nof my own future. Thus the capability of prudential reason seems to require for itsfull realization a deep acquaintance with caring relations, not only from the\nstandpoint of the cared-for but also from the standpoint of a caregiver.\n10Noddings argues for a stronger view that caring relations are the first and ultimate source of our\nconception of the good ( 1984 , 99). Even if this view is rejected as too strong (which I do not assert), the\nweaker claim that an appreciation of caring relations is essential to any adequate conception of the good\nhas intuitive plausibility.264 S.

To se et h i s ,i tm a yh e l pt or e f l e c tf i r s tu p o n\nthe moral psychology of the sort of person who never becomes comfortable orskilled in caregiving. Th is person refuses to take on a caring role out of fear of\nemotional exposure and anxiety about becoming \u201ctoo attached \u201dto the being who\nis cared-for, too vulnerable to the possibility of their loss and the attendant grief,\ntoo pained by unrequited longing for the cared-for to be made whole; or too\nangry, frustrated, or exhausted by the burdens that care entails. Most of us, Ithink, will find some or all of these fears recognizable \u2014we have seen them\nexpressed by others, or had such fears ou rselves. In such a condition, one either\ntakes on the caring role in spite of such fears (the reasons why need not matterhere) or one abdicates that role \u2014leaving it empty orleaving it to be filled by\nsomeone else. What difference does this choice make? A great deal of difference.The person who entirely succumbs to these fears lives as an absent, \u201cchecked-out \u201d\nparent, especially during a child \u2019s illness or disability. They find excuses to avoid\nsick friends recuperating at home. They cite a hatred of hospitals as a reason tolimit visits to dying parents. They become withdrawn and distant with a terminally\nill spouse. They may attempt to compensate by \u201cassisting \u201din ways that do not\nrequire much emotional exposure \u2014w o r k i n go v e r t i m et oh e l pw i t hm e d i c a lc o s t s ,\nsending flowers and food baskets by courier, buying an expensive van with awheelchair lift.

It is the abdication of caring practices that engraves those fears as thedominant feature of such a person \u2019s emotional landscape, crowding out all other\npossibilities. Meanwhile, the person who takes up caring practices \u2014even, perhaps,\nout of guilt or in response to social expectation \u2014is forced to confront those fears\nwith action. Caring actions will indeed bring precisely what the carer fears \u2014grief,\nlonging, anger, emotional exhaustion. But they can also allow those emotions to be\ngradually incorporated into a whole life, into living and sustaining attachments withother things and persons. Caring practices bring other emotions too \u2014such as the\ngratitude Nussbaum speaks of, whether it be for that one day the clouds of dementialifted a little and a parent \u2019s recognition reappeared, or the smile of an arthritic spouse\nafter a gentle massage, or gratitude for the child who begins to show maturity,independence, and her own capacity to care.\nOf course, caring practices in the absence of adequate resources and support can\nhave a powerfully destructive impact on our emotional, prudential, and social\ncapabilities \u2014the unmitigated stress, anxiety, physical, and mental exhaustion can\nresult in emotional withdrawal, a gradual numbing of affect, or extreme emotionalvolatility \u2014any or all of which can result in fractured relations with cared-fors and\nothers, severe depression, motivational apathy, impaired judgment, even completeemotional collapse.

The proper question is, in what particular, concrete\ncontexts will the use of carebots enhance caregivers \u2019capabilities by allowing them\nto sustain caring practices, and in what contexts will their use encourage us togradually surrender those practices, perhaps blind to the way in which such asurrender may negatively impact our fundamental capabilities ?\nRepeatedly, discussion o f these issues has skewed toward the impact on cared-\nfors rather than caregivers. Where the impact of carebots on caregivers is madecentral, it is entirely in terms of the potential benefits of being liberated fromcaregiving obligations, without consi deration of the attendant risks of such\nliberation (Bore nstein & Pearson 2010 ). For example, consider the dispute about\nwhether carebots will in fact come to gradually replace human caregivers, orwhether by freeing us from routine tasks they will \u201cmake room for more and\ndeeper human care \u201d(Coeckebergh 2009 ,1 8 3 ) ,h e l p i n gu st o \u201ccare better \u201d.T h i si s\nan important question, and the answer depends upon a number of social, economic,cultural, political, and technical varia bles that I will not attempt to enumerate.\nSome authors \u2019predictions about the future of carebot \u2013human relations are\ndistinctly pessimistic (Sparrow & Sparrow 2006 ), others more cautiously\noptimistic (Sharkey & Sharkey 2010 ; Borenstein & Pearson 2010 ). But in either\nscenario, the risks and benefits are wei ghed in a manner that ignores or minimizes\nthe potential value of caregiving to careg ivers. For example, there is a consensus\nthat \u201cthe elderly need contact with fellow human beings, \u201dand that if the use of\ncarebots led to depriving them of human contact, this would be ethicallyproblematic (Sharkey & Sharkey 2010 ; Borenstein & Pearson 2010 ). But no one\nasks whether we (potential caregivers) n eed contact with the elderly! Likewise, if\nu s i n gc a r e b o t st oh e l pu s \u201ccare better \u201dis seen as an ethically significant gain, it is\nseen as a gain in terms of the quality of care given to cared-fors \u2014they receive\n\u201cdeep \u201drather than \u201cshallow \u201dcare, which is clearly better for them (Coeckebergh\n2009 ). But it has not been asked whether being freed to \u201ccare better \u201dmight also be\nbetter for caregivers, by allowing them greater access to caregiving practices thatsustain or enrich their emotional, pr udential, and affiliative capabilities.\nThis impacts how we think about assessing the ethics of particular carebot uses \u2014\nwe focus on strategies that emphasize asking the elderly what levels of human/robotinteraction, respectively, they prefer (Sparrow & Sparrow 2006 ; Sharkey & Sharkey\n2010 ). The preferences of cared-fors are obviously critical here, and must be\nconsulted as part of any ethical approach. But by ignoring the value of caregivingpractices for caregivers, we open ourselves to a disturbing (though perhaps unlikely)scenario. Imagine a century from now that carebots have been developed which arenot only cheap, safe, and skilled, but good at keeping the elderly, children, andconvalescent persons happy\u2014amused, comforted, and distracted from their needs or\npains. Imagine that a great many people in this future would prefer to be cared for by\ncarebots than human caregivers, who still at times become impatient, dull, or angry\nin their company.

How would this impact theflourishing of human beings in the long run? Alternatively, imagine a scenario wherethe elderly or otherwise vulnerable prefer for aesthetic or tradition-bound reasons not\nto have robots involved in their care, but empirically we find that (1) limited uses ofcarebots for routine, physically demanding or tedious tasks free caregivers to sustain\nand enrich their own central human capabilities to a significant degree, and (2) that\nsuch uses have no negative impact on the central human capabilities of cared-fors. Isitclear that the preferences of cared-fors would be ethically definitive in such a\ncase?\nThere is yet another question we must pursue, related to the way in which\nnew technologies can radically change our contexts of practice in such a way asto alter the meaning of the goods internal to those practices. For example,Coeckebergh ( 2009 ) tells us that interactions with robots may not only support the\ndevelopment of a central human cap ability (such as play) but may also \u201credefine\nthat capability \u201d(220). This requires careful reflection. What would it mean to\n\u201credefine \u201dthe various capabilities that come together in, and are cultivated\nthrough, caregiving practi ces? How plastic is care? Can we stretch the definition of\nour capabilities in such a way that we cou ld accept the marketing of a carebot as\n\u201cenabling friends and family to care from afar \u201d(Sharkey & Sharkey 2010 )?

But beyond this, it is critical that thetask of perfecting our conceptual framework not occlude the concrete, empiricaldevelopments upon which we hope our framework will shed light, and which giveour attempts at theoretical precision their sole meaning. It has yet to become clearwhat carebots will be able to offer us beyond their current incubatory stage, orwhen they will become a genuine choice for potential caregivers as opposed to a\nmatter of fascinating specu lation for philosophers of technology. Nor do we know\nprecisely which cultural, economic, demo graphic, and psychological conditions\nwill be operative to influence caregivers \u2019motivations and choices if and when that\nday comes. It will be important for philosophers to attend closely to futuredevelopments in these respects, and to adjust their range and degree of moralconcern accordingly. In the meantime, philosophers can make a distinctivecontribution to preparing the moral community for such choices by encouragingreflection on the value of caring practices, not only for those cared for, but for\ncaregivers as well.Carebots and Caregivers 267", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "613c77e9-fac5-41d7-8de2-037bcd355f49": {"__data__": {"id_": "613c77e9-fac5-41d7-8de2-037bcd355f49", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "268", "file_name": "paper.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "583f4add-6e3f-41d1-bde9-4c22fc046c4b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "268", "file_name": "paper.pdf"}, "hash": "f56c4613f845379666782315ef529a585838b2368a563a36150c93d291f31e16"}}, "hash": "f56c4613f845379666782315ef529a585838b2368a563a36150c93d291f31e16", "text": "References\nAristotle (1984).
