Reed, Lady Arden, Lord Sales and Lord Burrows \nagree)  \nA. INTRODUCTION  \n1. Mr Richard Lloyd - with financial backing from Therium Litigation Funding IC, a \ncommercial litigation funder -  has issued a claim against Google LLC , alleging breach of \nits duties as a data controller under section 4(4) of the Data Protection Act 1998 (\u201cth e \nDPA 1998\u201d). The claim alleges that, for several months in late 2011 and early 2012, \nGoogle secretly tracked the internet activity of millions of Apple iPhone users and used \nthe data collected in this way for commercial purposes without the users\u2019 knowledge \nor consent.  \n2. The factual allegation is not new. In August 2012, Google agreed to pay a civil \npenalty of US$22.5m to settle charges brought by the United States Federal Trade \nCommission based upon the allegation. In November 2013, Google agreed to pay \nUS$17m to settle consumer -based actions brought against it in the United States. In \nEngland and Wales, three individuals sued Google in June 2013 making the same allegation and claiming compensation under the DPA 1998 and at common law for \nmisuse of private information: see Vidal -Hall v Google Inc (Information Comr \nintervening)  [2015] EWCA Civ 311; [2016] QB 1003. Following a dispute over \njurisdiction, their claims were settled before Google had served a defence. What is \nnew about the present action is that Mr  Lloyd is not just claiming damages in his own \nright, as the three claimants did in Vidal -Hall. He claims to represent everyone resident \nin England and Wales who owned an Apple iPhone at the relevant time and whose data were obtained by Google without thei r consent, and to be entitled to recover \ndamages on behalf of all these people. It is estimated that they number more than 4m.  \n3. Class actions, in which a single person is permitted to bring a claim and obtain \nredress on behalf of a class of people who have been affected in a similar way by alleged wrongdoing, have long been possible in the United States and, more recently, \nin Canada and Australia. Whether legislation to establish a class action regime should \nbe enacted in the UK has been much discussed. In 2009, the Government rejected a \nrecommendation from the Civil Justice Council to introduce a generic class action \nregime applicable to all types of claim, preferring a \u201csector based approach\u201d. This was \nfor two reasons:  \n\u201cFirstly, there are potential structur al differences between \nthe sectors which will require different consideration. \u2026 \nSecondly, it will be necessary to undertake a full assessment", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54d7824f-eb71-48ed-8b47-42b5efb0101e": {"__data__": {"id_": "54d7824f-eb71-48ed-8b47-42b5efb0101e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e3382890-75bd-4bd8-8762-981cab0b801e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "1dd867b1c8ba9f28e2df9193639d06f291be4828bbf04f39b41a70be41cdee19"}}, "hash": "033319d06b829892285edbed212d9bd984be8425d9d64a71730802ac46b5f1e2", "text": "Page 3 \n \n of the likely economic and other impacts before \nimplementing any reform.\u201d  \nSee the Government\u2019s Response to the Ci vil Justice Council\u2019s Report: \u201cImproving \nAccess to Justice through Collective Actions\u201d (2008), paras 12 -13. \n4. Since then, the only sector for which such a regime has so far been enacted is \nthat of competition law. Parliament has not legislated to establish a class action regime \nin the field of data protection.  \n5. Mr Lloyd has sought to overcome this difficulty by what the Court of Appeal in \nthis case described as \u201can unusual and innovative use of the representative procedure\u201d \nin rule 19.6 of the Civil Procedure Rules: see [2019] EWCA Civ 1599; [2020] QB 747, \npara 7. This is a procedure of very long standing in England and Wales whereby a claim can be brought by (or against) one or more persons as representatives of others who \nhave \u201cthe same interest\u201d in the claim . Mr Lloyd accepts that he could not use this \nprocedure to claim compensation on behalf of other iPhone users if the compensation \nrecoverable by each user would have to be individually assessed. But he contends that \nsuch individual assessment is unnecessar y. He argues that, as a matter of law, \ncompensation can be awarded under the DPA 1998 for \u201closs of control\u201d of personal data without the need to prove that the claimant suffered any financial loss or mental \ndistress as a result of the breach. Mr Lloyd furt her argues that a \u201cuniform sum\u201d of \ndamages can properly be awarded in relation to each person whose data protection \nrights have been infringed without the need to investigate any circumstances \nparticular to their individual case. The amount of damages reco verable per person \nwould be a matter for argument, but a figure of \u00a3750 was advanced in a letter of claim. Multiplied by the number of people whom Mr Lloyd claims to represent, this would \nproduce an award of damages of the order of \u00a33 billion.  \n6. Because Goog le is a Delaware corporation, the claimant needs the court\u2019s \npermission to serve the claim form on Google outside the jurisdiction. The application \nfor permission has been contested by Google on the grounds that the claim has no real \nprospect of success as: (1) damages cannot be awarded under the DPA 1998 for \u201closs \nof control\u201d of data without proof that it caused financial damage or distress; and (2) \nthe claim in any event is not suitable to proceed as a representative action. In the High \nCourt Warby J deci ded both issues in Google\u2019s favour and therefore refused permission \nto serve the proceedings on Google: see [2018] EWHC 2599 (QB); [2019] 1 WLR 1265. \nThe Court of Appeal reversed that decision, for reasons given in a judgment of the \nChancellor, Sir Geoffre y Vos, with which Davis LJ and Dame Victoria Sharp agreed: \n[2019] EWCA Civ 1599; [2020] QB 747.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8dfaf96-805d-4cf0-ba86-e88fc003fb32": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8dfaf96-805d-4cf0-ba86-e88fc003fb32", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4274b716-98ed-4b49-bfcc-005b57b512af", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "89209a2326c064ea313a9a565d673ca653c1cd05dabc87f7562c0dbbdf46b3aa"}}, "hash": "ce1123a2d05c9865d8c1e6bffca24ebf9e5637a1637e38f44cf11e20f398b1b1", "text": "Page 4 \n \n 7. On this further appeal, because of the potential ramifications of the issues \nraised, as well as hearing the claimant and Google, the c ourt has received written and \noral submissions from the Information Commissioner and written submissions from \nfive further interested parties.  \n8. In this judgment I will first summarise the facts alleged and the relevant legal \nframework for data protection before considering the different methods currently \navailable in English procedural law for claiming collective redress and, in particular, the \nrepresentative procedure which the claimant is seeking to use. Whether that \nprocedure is capable of being used in this case critically depends, as the claimant \naccepts, on whether compensation for the alleged breaches of data protection law \nwould need to be individually assessed. I will then consider the claimant\u2019s arguments \nthat individual assessment is unnecessary. For the reasons given in detail below, those \narguments cannot in my view withstand scrutiny. In order to recover compensation \nunder the DPA 1998 for any given individual, it would be necessary to show both that \nGoogle made some unlawful use of personal data relating to that individu al and that \nthe individual suffered some damage as a result. The claimant\u2019s attempt to recover compensation under the Act without proving either matter in any individual case is \ntherefore doomed to fail.  \nB. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n9. The relevant events took place between 9 August 2011 and 15 February 2012 \nand involved the alleged use by Google of what has been called the \u201cSafari \nworkaround\u201d to bypass privacy settings on Apple iPhones.  \n10. Safari is an internet browser developed by Apple and installed on its iPhones. A t \nthe relevant time, unlike most other internet browsers, all relevant versions of Safari \nwere set by default to block third party cookies. A \u201ccookie\u201d is a small block of data that is placed on a device when the user visits a website. A \u201cthird party cookie\u201d is a cookie \nplaced on the device not by the website visited by the user but by a third party whose \ncontent is included on that website. Third party cookies are often used to gather \ninformation about internet use, and in particular web pages visited over time, to \nenable the delivery to the user of advertisements tailored to interests inferred from \nthe user\u2019s browsing history.  \n11. Google had a cookie known as the \u201cDoubleClick Ad cookie\u201d which could operate \nas a third party cookie. It would be placed on a device if the user visited a website that \nincluded DoubleC lick Ad content. The DoubleClick Ad cookie enabled Google to \nidentify visits by the device to any website displaying an advertisement from its vast", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4008582-4378-4eeb-be33-76e23c036923": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4008582-4378-4eeb-be33-76e23c036923", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e04114a0-706a-4400-81a6-b6d2b1f175af", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "bb70f65057712a1172e8e55534c02ea792901f699788e483400cdd3e73606eb2"}}, "hash": "c29563958cfe9e879986bc6a78dd9263e22828cb00336e7e330b380031a311e6", "text": "Page 5 \n \n advertising network and to collect considerable amounts of information. It could tell \nthe date and time of any visit to a given website, how long the user spent there, which \npages were visited for how long, and what advertisements were viewed for how long. \nIn some cases, by means of the IP address of the browser, the user\u2019s approximate \ngeographical location could be identified.  \n12. Although the default settings for Safari blocked all third party cookies, a blanket \napplication of these settings would have prevented the use of certain popular web \nfunctions; so Apple d evised some exceptions to them. These exceptions were in place \nuntil March 2012, when the system was changed. But in the meantime the exceptions made it possible for Google to devise and implement the Safari workaround. Its effect \nwas to place the DoubleCl ick Ad cookie on an Apple device, without the user\u2019s \nknowledge or consent, immediately, whenever the user visited a website that \ncontained DoubleClick Ad content.  \n13. It is alleged that, in this way, Google was able to collect or infer information \nrelating not  only to users\u2019 internet surfing habits and location, but also about such \ndiverse factors as their interests and pastimes, race or ethnicity, social class, political or \nreligious beliefs or affiliations, health, sexual interests, age, gender and financial \nsituation.  \n14. Further, it is said that Google aggregated browser generated information from \nusers displaying similar patterns, creating groups with labels such as \u201cfootball lovers\u201d, \nor \u201ccurrent affairs enthusiasts\u201d. Google\u2019s DoubleClick service then offered t hese group \nlabels to subscribing advertisers to choose from when selecting the type of people at \nwhom they wanted to target their advertisements.  \nC. THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK  \n15. The DPA 1998 was enacted to implement Parliament and Council Directive \n95/46/EC of 24 O ctober 1995 \u201con the protection of individuals with regard to the \nprocessing of personal data and on the free movement of such data\u201d (OJ 1995 L281, p \n31) (the \u201cData Protection Directive\u201d). The Data Protection Directive has been \nsuperseded by the General Dat a Protection Regulation, which became law in the UK in \nMay 2018, supplemented by the Data Protection Act 2018 (\u201cthe DPA 2018\u201d). The DPA 2018 repealed and replaced the DPA 1998 except in relation to acts or omissions which \noccurred before it came into force .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82797175-d287-4660-8d8c-ae769534f236": {"__data__": {"id_": "82797175-d287-4660-8d8c-ae769534f236", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dbc7f1fb-e7b1-4c66-ae8f-f7634a779d0b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "32a372e9cf23143560e633704f42fd2ae3c8258d5703fa819458e55e9fee9699"}}, "hash": "cf0be7b700210fad948d69176fab5696dfd41d511e5aa39597d37da1ae30fbf5", "text": "Page 6 \n \n 16. Because the acts and omissions giving rise to the present claim occurred in 2011 \nand 2012, the claim is governed by the old law contained in the DPA 1998 and the Data \nProtection Directive. The parties and interveners in their submissions on this appeal \nnevertheless made frequent references to provisions of the General Data Protection \nRegulation and the DPA 2018. In principle, the meaning and effect of the DPA 1998 and \nthe Data Protection Directive cannot be affected by legislation which has been enacted \nsubsequently. The later legislation therefore cannot help to resolve the issues raised \non this appeal, and I shall leave it to one side.  \n(1) The scheme of the DPA 1998  \n17. Section 4(4) of the DPA 1998 imposed a duty on a data controller to comply \nwith \u201cthe dat a protection principles\u201d set out in Schedule 1 \u201cin relation to all personal \ndata with respect to which he is the data controller\u201d. As defined in section 1(1) of the \nAct, \u201cpersonal data\u201d are, in effect, all recorded information which relate to an \nidentifiable individual. An individual who is the subject of personal data is referred to \nas the \u201cdata subject\u201d. A \u201cdata controller\u201d is a person who (either alone or with others) \n\u201cdetermines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal data are, or \nare to be, processed.\u201d The term \u201cprocessing\u201d is defined very broadly to mean \n\u201cobtaining, recording or holding the information or data or carrying out any operation or set of operations on the information or data \u2026\u201d. Section 2 of the Act establishes a \ncategor y of \u201csensitive personal data\u201d consisting of information about certain specified \nmatters, which include the racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, \nphysical or mental health or sexual life of the data subject.  \n18. The first of the eight \u201cdata protection principles\u201d set out in Schedule 1 is that:  \n\u201cPersonal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in \nparticular, shall not be processed unless -  \n(a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met, and \n(b) in the case of sensitive personal data, at least one \nof the conditions in Schedule 3 is also met.\u201d  \nThe other seven data protection principles, in summary, require personal data: (2) to be obtained and processed only for specified and lawful purposes; (3) to be \u201cadequate,  \nrelevant, and not excessive\u201d in relation to those purposes; (4) to be accurate and,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "392ff246-2a2d-4f11-8852-c4fec971ec1a": {"__data__": {"id_": "392ff246-2a2d-4f11-8852-c4fec971ec1a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e48b76f-942e-4a3d-875b-e3f4d05fbab6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "1fe8bb2991092ecff1056f78720298212a220f1c200f21e9c5ad5bc696e716c0"}}, "hash": "c6de1dd50fe253ec36e02da3819bdfc3333114cd95ca00252c653ee14cbe5ab0", "text": "Page 7 \n \n where necessary, kept up to date; (5) not to be kept for longer than is necessary for \nthose purposes; (6) to be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects \nunder the Act; (7) to be protected by appropriate technical and organisational security \nmeasures against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss or \ndestruction or damage; and (8) not to be transferred outside the European Economic \nArea unless the destination country or territory provides an adequate level of \nprotection for data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.  \n19. As discussed in more detail below, section 13 of the DPA 1998 gives an \nindividual who suffers damage \u201cby reason of any contravention by a data controller of \nany of the requirements of this Act\u201d a right to compensation from the data controller for that damage.  \n(2) The allegations of breach of duty  \n20. The claimant, Mr Lloyd, contends that Google processed person al data of each \nmember of the represented class in breach of the first, second and seventh data protection principles. The represented class consists in essence of everyone in England \nand Wales who at the relevant time had an Apple iPhone on which Google\u2019s  \nDoubleClick Ad cookie was placed through the Safari workaround. (The precise definition of the class is set out at para 19 of Warby J\u2019s judgment.) Two principal \nallegations made are that, in breach of the first data protection principle, (i) the data \nobta ined by placing the DoubleClick Ad cookie on each class member\u2019s device were not \nprocessed fairly and (ii) none of the conditions in Schedule 2 (or 3) was met.  \n21. Schedule 1, Part II, paragraph 2, provides, in substance, that personal data \nobtained from the data subject are not to be treated as processed fairly unless the data controller informs the data subject of the purpose for which the data are \nintended to be processed -  a requirement with which it is said that Google failed to \ncomply in this case.  \n22. Schedule 2 contains a list of conditions capable of justifying the processing of \ndata. To comply with the first data protection principle, at least one of these conditions must be satisfied. The first condition in Schedule 2 is that \u201cthe data subject \nhas given h is consent to the processing\u201d. Other conditions are that the processing is \nnecessary for (amongst other things): the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party; or compliance with a legal obligation (other than a contractual \nobligation) of the data controller; or to protect the vital interests of the data subject; \nor for the exercise of any functions of a public nature exercised in the public interest \nby any person. The claimant asserts that the members of the represented class whose", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f7f3d8b-e249-4374-806c-b369480c45eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f7f3d8b-e249-4374-806c-b369480c45eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d24bc552-def5-4c91-91e7-566e4a2a8295", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "c7dd07026fc0fb362eed6c999d56008aad5e34726840c4e451793af1341ed877"}}, "hash": "8bbb5d78a7e3d114a60ec3849ea5e6a9c2e5963aec7dce2533f0f78e865dc6c7", "text": "Page 8 \n \n personal data Google processed had not given their consent to the processing, nor was \nany of the other conditions capable of justifying the processing met. Hence for this \nreason too Google was in breach of the first data protection principle.  \n23. There is no doubt that the claimant is entitled to advance a claim against Google \non this basis in his own right which has a real prospect of success. The issue is whether \nhe can also do so on behalf of all other iPhone users who fall within the represented \nclass. This de pends on the scope of the representative procedure available under the \nCivil Procedure Rules (\u201cCPR\u201d). Before I come to that procedure, I will mention in order \nto compare them the two other methods of claiming collective redress currently \navailable in Engli sh procedural law.  \nD. COLLECTIVE REDRESS IN ENGLISH LAW  \n(1) Group Actions  \n24. A group of people who wish to bring claims which give rise to common or \nrelated issues of fact or law can apply to the court for a Group Litigation Order to be \nmade under CPR rule 19.11, providing for the claims to be managed together, usually \nby a single designated judge. The Group Litigation Order will establish a register of the \nclaims included in the group, which is maintained by the claimants\u2019 lead solicitor. The \norder may also m ake provision for how the litigation costs are to be shared among the \nclaimants. How the claims are managed is a matter for the designated judge, but \nprocedures typically used are to select one or more claims to be tried as test claims \nwhile the remaining claims are stayed and to decide as preliminary issues common \nissues of law or fact which are potentially dispositive of the litigation. Unless the court \norders otherwise, a judgment given or order made in the litigation is binding on all the \nclaimants included in the group register: see CPR rule 19.12(1)(a).  \n25. Where the individual claims are of sufficiently high value, group actions can be \nan effective way of enabling what are typically several hundred or thousands of claims \nto be litigated and managed together, avoiding duplication of the court\u2019s resources \nand allowing the claimants to benefit from sharing costs and litigation risk and by \nobtaining a single judgment which is binding in relation to all their claims. However, \nthe group action procedure suffers from the drawback that it is an \u201copt -in\u201d regime: in \nother words, claimants must take active steps to join the group. This has an administrative cost, as a solicitor conducting the litigation has to obtain sufficient \ninformation from a potential claimant to  determine whether he or she is eligible to be \nadded to the group register, give appropriate advice and enter into a retainer with the \nclient.

Another limitation of opt -in proceedings is that experience has shown that only \na relatively small proportion of those eligible to join the group are likely to do so, \nparticularly if the number of people affected is large and the value of each individual \nclaim relatively small. For example, a group action was recently brought against the \nMorrisons supermarket chain for compensation for breach of the DPA 1998 arising \nfrom the disclosure on the internet by a Morrisons\u2019 employee of personal data relating \nto other employees. Of around 100,000 affected employees, fewer than 10,000 opted \nto join the group action: see Various Claimants v Wm Morrisons Supermarket s plc \n[2017] EWHC 3113 (QB); [2019] QB 772 (reversed on the issue of vicarious liability by the Supreme Court: [2020] UKSC 12; [2020] AC 989). During the period of more than 12 \nyears in which collective proceedings under the Competition Act 1998 (discussed \nbelow) could be brought only on an opt -in basis just one action was commenced, \nbased on a finding of price fixing in the sale of replica football shirts. Although around 1.2 \u2013 1.5m people were affected, despite widespread publicity only 130 people opted \ninto the proceedings: see The Consumers' Association v JJB Sports Plc  [2009] CAT 2, \npara 5; Civil Justice Council Report \u201cImproving Access to Justice through Collective Actions\u201d (2008), Part 6, para 22; and Grave D, McIntosh M and Rowan G (eds), Class \nActions in England and Wales , 1st ed (2018), par a 1-068.  \n27. Likely explanations for the low participation rates typically experienced in opt -in \nregimes include lack of awareness of the opportunity to join the litigation and the natural human tendency to do nothing when faced with a choice which requires \npositive action -  particularly if there is no immediate benefit to be gained and the \nconsequences are uncertain and not easy to understand: see eg Thaler R and Sunstein C, Nudge: The Final Edition  (2021) , pp 36- 38; Samuelson W and Zeckhauser R, \u201cStatus \nQuo Bias in Decision Making\u201d (1988) 1 Journal of Risk and Uncertainty 7- 59.

A further factor which makes group litigation impractical in cases where the loss \nsuffered by each individual is small, even if in aggregate it may amount to a very large \nsum of money, is the need to prove the quantum of loss in each individual case. Not \nonly are eligible individuals less likely to opt into the proceedings where the potential \ngain to them is small, but the costs of obtaining evidence from each individual to \nsupport their claim is again likely to make group litigation uneconomic in such cases.  \n(2) Collective Proceedings  \n29. Compared to group actions, the method of collective redress which is now \navailable in the field of competition law offers significant advantages for claimants, particularly where many people have been affected by the defendant\u2019s conduct but \nthe value of each individual claim is small. Section 47B of the Competition Act 1998 \n(added by the Enterprise Act 2002 and as amended by the Consumer Rights Act 2015) \nmakes provision for bringing \u201ccollective proceedings\u201d in the Competition Appeal \nTribunal (\u201cCAT\u201d) combin ing two or more claims to which section 47A applies \n(essentially, claims in respect of an infringement or alleged infringement of competition law). Such proceedings must be commenced by a person who proposes to \nbe the representative of a specified class of  persons, and the proceedings may only be \ncontinued if they are certified by the CAT as satisfying criteria set out in section 47B \nand in the CAT Rules. Two features of this regime may be noted.  \n30. First, unlike group litigation, collective proceedings may be  brought on either an \n\u201copt -in\u201d or \u201copt- out\u201d basis. \u201cOpt- out\u201d collective proceedings are proceedings brought \non behalf of each class member except any member who opts out by notifying the \nclass representative that their claim should not be included in the proceedings: see \nsection 47B(11) . Where \u201copt -out\u201d collective proceedings are permitted, a person may \ntherefore have a claim brought on their behalf  without taking any affirmative step and, \npotentially, without even knowing of the existence of the proceedings and the fact that he or she is represented in them.  \n31. A second significant feature of the collective proceedings regime is that it \nenables liability to be established and damages recovered without the need to prove", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a96d70c7-1997-4af6-820d-3d7f92ec304d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a96d70c7-1997-4af6-820d-3d7f92ec304d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2a940e2-326c-4369-8c71-840a1d7206b7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "1db7a62036cd18880b654b4e7862249bbd7652877d20dbfdd50cb7b995bb0f03"}}, "hash": "3272c289371ad4c9005345fb5257c5c5adac65bf6c08972acc6e2e385a5c95e7", "text": "Page 11 \n \n that members of the class have individually suffered loss: it is sufficient to show t hat \nloss has been suffered by the class viewed as a whole. This is the effect of section \n47C(2) of the Competition Act, which provides:  \n\u201cThe tribunal may make an award of damages in collective \nproceedings without undertaking an assessment of the \namount of damages recoverable in respect of the claim of \neach represented person.\u201d  \nSuch an award of damages is referred to in the CAT Rules as \u201can aggregate award of \ndamages\u201d: see rule 73(2) . \n32. As Lord Briggs explained in Merricks v Mastercard [2020] UKSC 51; [2021] Bus LR \n25, at para 76, section 47C(2) of the Competition Act \u201cradically alters the established \ncommon law compensatory principle by removing the requirement to assess individual \nloss\u201d. This is so for the purposes both of making and o f paying out an aggregate award \nof damages. How an aggregate award of damages is distributed among the members of the class is subject to the control of the CAT and, as this court held in Merricks v \nMastercard , the only requirement is that the distribution should be just: see paras 76-\n77, 149. No doubt in many cases a just method of distribution will be one which divides \nup an aggregate award of damages in a way which takes account of individual loss. But \nparticularly where the size of the class is large an d the amount of damages awarded \nsmall considered on a per capita basis, it may be impractical or disproportionate to \nadopt such a method. In such cases some other method of distribution, such as an \nequal division among all the members of the class, may be justified.  \n(3) Representative Actions  \n33. Collective proceedings are a recent phenomenon in English law. By contrast, the \nrepresentative procedure which the claimant is seeking to use in this case has existed \nfor several hundred years. The current version of t he representative rule is CPR rule \n19.6, which states:  \n\u201c(1) Where more than one person has the same interest in \na claim -  \n(a) the claim may be begun; or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7db89949-6bc0-4f95-9636-aadc0ff83ce2": {"__data__": {"id_": "7db89949-6bc0-4f95-9636-aadc0ff83ce2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "928edc65-0145-4ff1-ad28-7640c122596f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "1bc8c20571dc23ec0417304145942aa423894b24410a44d7f407e453808c6e81"}}, "hash": "e9d0e231516c02334111d9a4e928c8cbb41264edca1e6f5908bc603784ddb491", "text": "Page 12 \n \n (b) the court may order that the claim be continued,  \nby or against one or more of the persons who have the same \ninterest as representatives of any other persons who have \nthat interest.  \n(2) The court may direct that a person may not act as a \nrepresentative.  \n(3) Any party may apply to the court for an order under \nparagraph (2).  \n(4) Unless the court otherwise directs any judgment or \norder given in a claim in which a party is acting as a \nrepresentative under this rule -  \n(a) is binding on all persons represented in the claim; \nbut \n(b) may only be enforced by or against a person who is not a party to the claim with the permission of the \ncourt.\u201d  \n(a) Origins of the rule  \n34. This rule has its origins in the procedure of the Court of Chancery before the \nJudicature Act of 1873. The general rule was that all persons materially interested in the subject -matter of a suit should be made parties to it, either as claimants or \ndefendants, so as to ensure that the rights of all persons interested were settled by a single judgment of the court: see eg Adair v New River Co  (1805) 11 Ves Jr 429; 32 ER \n1153; Cockburn v Thompson (1809) 16 Ves Jr 321; 33 ER 1005. However, to join all \ninterested persons as parties was not always practically convenient - particularly if they \nwere very numerous. The solution devised was not to abandon the aim of settling the rights of all interested persons in a single proceeding; rather, it was to relax the \n\u201ccomplete joinder rule\u201d by allowing one or more claimants or defendants to represent all others who had the same interest as them: see Sorabji J, \u201cThe hidden class action in \nEnglish civil procedure\u201d (2009) 28 CJQ 498.

In the very early cases in the 16th and 17th centuries in which this procedure \nwas adopted, the persons represented were invariably a cohesive communal group, \nsuch as parishioners or manorial tenants, whose members had agreed to be \nrepresented; and the representatives were often required to show proof of their \nauthority to represent the group. But as the nature of society changed and new, more \nimpersonal institutions such as friendly societies and joint stock companies with \nmultiple investors emerged, this requirement was dropped. The court allowed persons \nto be represented whether or not they had consented to such representation or even \nknew of the action, relying on community of interest among the members of the group \nto ensure that the interests of all were adequately protected: see Yeazell, \u201cFrom Group \nLitigation to Class Action, Part I: The Industrialization of Group Litigation\u201d (1980) 27 UCLA Law Review 514.  \n36. Many of the formative cases involved joint stock companies at a time (before \nthe Joint Stock Companies Acts 1844 to 1858) when such companies were not yet \nrecognised as separate legal entities which could sue or be sued. An action had \ntherefore to be brought by (or against) the members themselves. In Chancey v May  \n(1722) Precedents in Chancery 592; 24 ER 265, the treasurer and manager of a brass -\nworks brought an action on behalf of themselves and all other proprietors of the \nundertaking, of whom there were 800 in total, except for the defendants, who were its \nformer managers, to call the defendants to account for alleged mismanagement and \nembezzlement. The defendants objected that the claim should not be allowed to \nproc eed as the rest of the proprietors had not been made parties. The court dismissed \nthat objection on the grounds that, first, the action had been brought on behalf of all \nthe other proprietors, so that \u201call the rest were in effect parties\u201d, and secondly:  \n\u201cBecause it would be impracticable to make them all parties \nby name, and there would be continual abatements by death \nand otherwise, and no coming at justice, if all were to be \nmade parties.\u201d  \n37. Another notable case involving a joint stock company was Meux v Ma ltby (1818) \n2 Swanston 277; 36 ER 621. In this case the treasurer and directors of the company \nwere sued as representative defendants on a contract made on behalf of all the \nmembers of the company to grant a lease. In rejecting an argument that the claim w as \ndefective because not all the proprietors were before the court, Plumer MR explained, \nat pp 281- 282:  \n\u201cThe general rule, which requires the plaintiff to bring before \nthe c ourt all the parties interested in the subject in question, \nadmits of exceptions.

In Duke of Bedford v Ellis  [1901] AC 1, 8, Lord Macnaghten summarised the \npractice of the Court of Chancery in this way:  \n\u201cThe old rule in the Court of Chancery was very simple and \nperfectly well understood. Under the old practice the Court \nrequired the presence of all parties interested in the matter \nin suit, in order that a final end might be made of the \ncontroversy. But when the parties were so numerous that \nyou never c ould \u2018come at justice\u2019, to use an expression in one \nof the older cases, if everybody interested was made a party, \nthe rule was not allowed to stand in the way. It was originally \na rule of convenience: for the sake of convenience it was \nrelaxed. Given a com mon interest and a common grievance, \na representative suit was in order if the relief sought was in its nature beneficial to all whom the plaintiff proposed to represent.\u201d  \n(b) Effect of the Judicature Act  \n39. By the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, all the jurisdiction previously \nexercised by the Court of Chancery and the courts of common law was transferred to and vested in the new High Court of Justice. Rules of procedure for the High Court were scheduled to the Act, which included as rule 10:  \n\u201cWhere there are numerous parties having the same interest \nin one action, one or more of such parties may sue or be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fff3b9b-fede-43c5-9d6c-59a6e9daa66a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fff3b9b-fede-43c5-9d6c-59a6e9daa66a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7c65409a-92a2-4a4c-9341-162d9f6dc755", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "64043fe07a87c83cddf783e85025f4b1ce85ebb2adc36c3033ef572a30404395"}}, "hash": "a3d50f692a902ebc218644ce95128e786aff2f8e954614cbb0e249699bc88dcd", "text": "Page 15 \n \n sued, or may be authorised by the court to defend in such \naction, on behalf or for the benefit of all parties so \ninterested.\u201d  \nThis rule became O rder 16, rule 9 of the Rules of the Supreme Court and has remained \nin force in the same or similar form ever since. Save that the requirement for \n\u201cnumerous parties\u201d has been reduced to \u201cmore than one\u201d, there is no significant difference in the current vers ion of the rule, quoted at para 33 above.  \n40. At first after the enactment of the Judicature Act the courts construed the new \nrule narrowly. In Temperton v Russell [1893] 1 QB 435, 438, Lindley LJ, who gave the \njudgment of the Court of Appeal, expressed the vi ew that the rule only applied to \n\u201cpersons who have or claim some beneficial proprietary right\u201d which they are asserting \nor defending in an action that would have come within the jurisdiction of the old Court \nof Chancery; hence the rule did not apply to a c laim for damages in tort. That view, \nhowever, was repudiated by the House of Lords in Duke of Bedford v Ellis  [1901] AC 1. \nSix individuals sued the Duke of Bedford, who owned Covent Garden Market, on behalf \nof themselves and all other growers of fruit, flo wers, vegetables, roots and herbs, to \nenforce certain preferential rights claimed under the Covent Garden Market Act 1828 to stands in the market. They sought declarations of the rights of the growers and an \ninjunction to restrain the Duke from acting inco nsistently with those rights. They also \nclaimed -  though only for themselves and not on behalf of other growers -  an account \nand repayment of sums charged to them for selling at the market in excess of what \nthey would have paid if afforded their alleged pr eferential rights. The Duke applied to \nhave the action stayed either on the ground that the claimants had no beneficial \nproprietary right, or on the ground that the joinder in one action of parties claiming \nseparate and different rights under the Act, both personally and as representing a \nclass, would embarrass or delay the trial. The House of Lords rejected both grounds \n(the first unanimously and the second by a majority of 3 to 2) and held that the action \ncould be maintained.  \n41. Lord Macnaghten, who gave the leading speech, expressly disapproved the \nrestrictive view of the representative rule expressed in Temperton v Russell and \nconfirmed that its purpose was simply to apply the practice of the Court of Chancery to \nall divisions of the High Court. The only ch ange was therefore that the rule was now \napplicable in actions which, before the Judicature Act, could only have been brought in \na court of common law. He said, at pp 10- 11, that:  \n\u201c\u2026 in all other respects I think the rule as to representative \nsuits remains very much as it was a hundred years ago.

In Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants  [1901] AC \n426, 443, Lord Lindley (as he had become) went out of his way to endorse this view \nand to retract his earlier observations in Temperton v Russell , stating:  \n\u201cThe principle on which the rule is based forbids its \nrestriction to cases for which an exact precedent can be \nfound in the reports. The principle is as applicable to new \ncases as to old, and ought to be applied to the exigencies of \nmodern life as occasion  requires. The rule itself has been \nembodied and made applicable to the various Divisions of the \nHigh Court by the Judicature Act, 1873, sections 16 and 23-\n25, and Order XVI, rule 9; and the unfortunate observations \nmade on that rule in Temperton v Russell  have been happily \ncorrected in this House in the Duke of Bedford v Ellis  and in \nthe course of the argument in the present case.\u201d", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80059cf3-3855-4127-93be-bc990de45454": {"__data__": {"id_": "80059cf3-3855-4127-93be-bc990de45454", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "08ca5b01-81df-441c-a423-042b09820357", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "9d60b77e0b96ad21f9ee041b7ee4457adabdebb92ac1f93e2ec96ec208471343"}}, "hash": "381dd252f9f1fcc6733ce6e41d9b9f24b3a8f0cd30468f733acfd0560d52f8f1", "text": "Page 17 \n \n (c) Markt  and declarations of rights  \n43. The subsequent decision of the Court of Appeal in Markt & Co Ltd v Knight \nSteamship Co Lt d [1910] 2 KB 1021 has sometimes been seen as undermining the \nbroad and flexible view of the representative rule adumbrated by the House of Lords in \nthese two cases by imposing significant constraints on its use: see eg Esanda Finance \nCorpn Ltd v Carnie  (1992) 29 NSWLR 382, 395; Mulheron R, The Class Action in \nCommon Law Legal Systems  (2004) pp 78- 82; Sorabji J, \u201cThe hidden class action in \nEnglish civil procedure\u201d (2009) 28 CJQ 498. I do not think, however, that the decision \nshould be understood in this way . Markt  was heard together with another action also \nbrought against the owners of a cargo vessel which was intercepted by a Russian \ncruiser on a voyage to Japan during the Russo -Japanese war, on suspicion of carrying \ncontraband of war, and sunk. Just befor e the limitation period expired, two cargo -\nowners issued writs \u201con behalf of themselves and others owners of cargo lately laden \non board\u201d the vessel, claiming \u201cdamages for breach of contract and duty in and about the carriage of goods by sea\u201d . No further particulars of the claims were given.  \n44. All three members of the Court of Appeal agreed that the claims as formulated \ncould not be pursued as representative actions as there was no basis for asserting that all the cargo owners had the same interest in the act ions. That was so if only because a \nclaim that the shipowners were in breach of duty in carrying contraband goods plainly could not be maintained on behalf of any cargo -owners who had themselves shipped \nsuch goods; furthermore, each cargo owner would need to prove their individual loss. \nBuckley LJ would have allowed the claimants to amend their writs and continue the \nproceedings on behalf of themselves and all cargo -owners who were not shippers of \ncontraband goods, claiming a declaration that the defendants  were in breach of \ncontract and duty in shipping contraband of war. The other judges, however, did not \nagree to this course. Vaughan Williams LJ, at p 1032, rejected it on the grounds that \nthe proposed amendment had not been brought before the court in a w ay which gave \na proper opportunity for argument and doubted anyway whether the amendment \ncould be so framed as to disclose a common purpose of the shippers or any class of the \nshippers. Fletcher Moulton LJ, at p 1042, considered that making a declaration o f the \ntype suggested would be contrary to the practice of the courts and that subsequent claims by individual cargo -owners relying on such a declaration to recover damages \nwould constitute new claims which would be time- barred, as the limitation period had \nnow expired.  \n45. The readiness of English courts to give judgments declaring legal rights where it \nwould serve a useful purpose has much increased since 1910. An important step was \nthe decision of the Court of Appeal in Guaranty Trust Co of New York v Hannay & Co \n[1915] 2 KB 536, which held that a declaration can be granted at the instance of a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46b12afa-79fa-48cd-aa94-3fdc0731ae6a": {"__data__": {"id_": "46b12afa-79fa-48cd-aa94-3fdc0731ae6a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c58af979-357a-4675-a681-dcb67db796ec", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "ee6c125da00a5f104aeef4e6e1681d91b165ee3d92f298885b1e2d62190a1cda"}}, "hash": "057032f0e38d6d89bb785290622c56eefc424e5b3e9bbb0377fbd13868895261", "text": "Page 18 \n \n claimant even if the claimant has no cause of action against the defendant. Two cases \ndecided together by the Court of Appeal in 1921 showed that there is no reason in \nprinciple why a claim for a declaration of the kind suggested by Buckley LJ in Markt  \ncannot be brought as a representative action. In David Jones v Cory Bros & Co Ltd  \n(1921) 56 LJ 302; 152 LT Jo 70, five individuals sued on their own behalf and on behalf \nof all other underground and surface workmen employed at the defendant\u2019s colliery \non three specified days in September 1919. They alleged that on those three days the \nsafety lamps in use at the colliery were not in accordance with statutory requirements, \nwere insufficient in number and were not properly examined; and that in consequence \nthe workmen justifiably refused to go to work and lost the wages they would \notherwise have earned and were entitled to damages. In Thomas v Great Mountain \nCollieries Co, whic h was heard at the same time, two claimants sued the owner of \nanother colliery for loss of wages, alleging breach of statutory duty in not having a weighing machine to weigh coal as near the pit mouth as was reasonably practicable. \nThe workmen were divided into two classes - one comprising all workmen whose \nwages depended on the amount of coal gotten and the other comprising all other underground and surface workmen. The claimants sued on their own behalf and on \nbehalf of the class they respectively represented.  \n46. In each action the claims were divisible under three heads: (1) claims for \ndeclarations upon matters in which the classes represented were alleged to have a \ncommon interest; (2) claims for damages by the individual named claimants; and (3) \nclaims for damages by the individual members of the classes represented. \nUnfortunately, only a bare summary of the judgments is reported. But this records that the Court of Appeal by a majority (Bankes and Atkin LJJ, with Scrutton LJ dissenting) \nheld that the claimants were entitled to sue in a representative capacity as regards claims that came within (1) and (2), but not as regards claims for damages by the \nindividual members of the classes represented.  \n47. In Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd  [1981] Ch 229 the \nclaimant brought a derivative action as a minority shareholder of the first defendant \ncompany claiming damages on behalf of the company against two of its directors for \nbreach of duty and conspiracy. At the start of the hearing the claimant appl ied to \namend its statement of claim to add a personal claim against the directors and the \ncompany, brought in a representative capacity on behalf of all the shareholders. The \nrelief sought was a declaration that those shareholders who had suffered loss as a \nresult of the alleged conspiracy were entitled to damages. The judge (Vinelott J) allowed the amendment. He distinguished Markt  and followed David Jones v Cory Bros  \nin holding that a representative claim for a declaration could be pursued notwithstanding  that each member of the class of persons represented had a separate \ncause of action.

This decision was important in demonstrating the potential for a bifurcated \nprocess whereby issues common to the claims of a class of persons may be decided in \na representative action which, if successful, can then form a basis for individual claims \nfor redress. More generally, the Prudential case marked a welcome revival of the spirit of flexibility which characterised the old case law.  \n(d) Claims fo r damages  \n49. In the cases so far mentioned where claims were held to come within the scope \nof the representative rule, the relief claimed on behalf of the represented class was limited to a declaration of legal rights. It was accepted or held that the named \nclaimants could only claim damages or other monetary relief in their personal capacity. \nIn Markt  Fletcher Moulton LJ expressed the view, at pp 1035 and 1040- 1041, that \ndamages are \u201ca personal relief\u201d and that:  \n\u201cno representative action can lie where the sol e relief sought \nis damages, because they have to be proved separately in the case of each plaintiff, and therefore the possibility of \nrepresentation ceases.\u201d  \n50. In many cases, of which Markt  was one, it is clearly correct that the assessment \nof damages depends on circumstances personal to each individual claimant. In such \ncases it is unlikely to be practical or fair to assess damages on a common basis and \nwithout each individual claimant\u2019s participation in the proceedings. However, this is \nnot always so, and r epresentative actions for damages have sometimes been allowed. \nFor example, in the case of insurance underwritten by Lloyd\u2019s syndicates, which are not separate legal entities, it is standard practice for a single member of the syndicate \n(usually the leading underwriter) to be named as a representative claimant or \ndefendant suing, or being sued, for themselves and all the other members. There is no \ndifficulty in awarding damages for or against the representative in such proceedings, as \nthe calculation of any  damages which the members of the syndicate are collectively \nentitled to recover or liable to pay does not depend on how the risk is divided among \nthe members of the syndicate.  \n51.

It \nmade no difference that there was a dispute between one of the claimants  and some \nmembers of the syndicate about the validity of the quota share reinsurance, since as Lloyd LJ said, at p 571: \u201cthe question is whether the parties have the same interest as \nagainst the defendants; not whether they have the same interest as between \nthemselves\u201d.  \n52. In Irish Shipping Ltd v Commercial Union Assurance Co plc (The \u201cIrish Rowan\u201d) \n[1991] 2 QB 206 numerous insurers had subscribed in various proportions to a policy of \nmarine insurance. The Court of Appeal accepted that, as a matter of law, eac h \nsubscription constituted a separate contract of insurance (of which there were said to be 77 in all). Claims for losses allegedly covered by the policy were made by suing two \nof the insurers as representative defendants. The Court of Appeal rejected an \nargument that claims for debt or damages could not be included in a representative \naction, merely because they are made by numerous claimants individually or resisted \nby numerous defendants individually, and held that the action could continue as a \nrepresen tative action. While the policy terms contained a broadly worded leading \nunderwriter clause, the presence of this clause was not essential to the decision: see Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association v Taylor (The Kyriaki)  [1992] 1 \nLloyd\u2019s R ep 484, 493- 494; National Bank of Greece SA v Outhwaite  [2001] CLC 591, \npara 31.  \n53. In EMI Records Ltd v Riley  [1981] 1 WLR 923, and in Independiente Ltd v Music \nTrading On- Line (HK) Ltd  [2003] EWHC 470 (Ch), the claimants sued in a representative \ncapacity on  behalf of all members of the British Phonographic Industry Ltd (\u201cBPI\u201d), a \ntrade association for the recorded music industry (and also in the latter case on behalf \nof Phonographic Performance Ltd), claiming damages for breach of copyright in selling \npirate d sound recordings. In each case the claims were allowed to proceed as \nrepresentative actions. Because it was accepted or could safely be assumed that the \nowner of the copyright in any pirated recording was a member of the represented \nclass, this procedure  enabled breach of copyright to be proved and damages to be \nawarded without the need to prove which particular pirated recordings had been sold in what quantities. Again, what mattered was that the members of the class had a community of interest in suing the defendant.  \n54. In EMI Records  it was asserted, and not disputed by the defendants, that the \nmembers of the BPI had consented to all sums recovered in actions for breach of copyright being paid to the BPI: see [1981] 1 WLR 923, 925.

Although not cited in these cases, the same point had been made long before in \nWarrick v Queen\u2019s College Oxford (No  4) (187 1) LR 6 Ch App 716, 726, where Lord \nHatherley LC gave an example of:  \n\u201cclasses of shareholders in a railway company who have \ndifferent rights inter se, but they may all have a common \nenem y in the shape of a fraudulent director, and they may all \njoin, of course, in one common suit against that director, \nalthough after the common right is established they may \nhave a considerable litigation among themselves as to who \nare the persons entitled to the gains obtained through that suit.\u201d  \nWhile the right enforced in such a common suit would in modern company law be seen as a right belonging to the company itself, rather than its shareholders, it is clear from \nthe context that Lord Hatherley had in mind a representative action brought on behalf \nof shareholders, as he gave this analogy to explain how in that case a representative \nclaim could be brought on behalf of all the freehold tenants of a manor to establish \ncommon rights against the lord of the manor even though different tenants or classes of tenant had different rights as between themselves.  \n(e) Emerald Supplies  \n56. In giving the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in the present case, the Chancellor, at \n[2020] QB 747, para 73, focused on Emerald Supplies L td v British Airways plc  [2010] \nEWCA Civ 1284; [2011] Ch 345 as providing the latest authoritative interpretation of \nthe representative rule. The decision in that case turned, however, on the particular \nway in which the class of represented persons had bee n defined. The claimants alleged \nthat the defendant airline was a party to agreements or concerted practices with other \nairlines to fix prices for air freight charged for importing cut flowers into the UK. They \nclaimed on behalf of all \u201cdirect or indirect purchasers of air freight services, the prices \nfor which were inflated by the agreements or concerted practices\u201d, a declaration that \ndamages were recoverable in principle from the defendant by those purchasers.

Such \nan approach would not be just, not least because, if the claim failed, no purchasers of \nair freight services apart from the named claimants would be bound by the result.  \n57. The Court of Appeal in Emerald Supplies also consid ered that a second difficulty \nwith the class definition was that the members of the represented class did not all \nhave the same interest in the claim, as there was a conflict of interest between direct \nand indirect purchasers of air freight services: see paras 28 -29 and 64. If it was shown \nthat prices had been inflated by agreements or concerted practices to which the defendant was a party, it would be in the interests of direct purchasers to seek to \nprove that they had absorbed the higher prices in order t o avoid a potential defence \nthat they had suffered no loss because the higher prices had been passed on to \u201cindirect purchasers\u201d (understood to include sub- purchasers). On the other hand, it \nwould be in the interests of such indirect purchasers to seek to prove that the higher \nprices had indeed been passed on to them.  \n58. It seems to me that this second difficulty might have been avoided either by \naltering the class definition to exclude sub -purchasers or by following the approach \nadopted in Prudential of claim ing a declaration that those members of the class who \nhad suffered damage as a result of the alleged price fixing were entitled to damages. \nHowever, those possibilities do not appear to have been considered. I think that the \njudge in Rendlesham Estates plc  v Barr Ltd  [2014] EWHC 3968 (TCC); [2015] 1 WLR \n3663 -  a case relied on by Google on this appeal -  was therefore wrong to conclude \nfrom Emerald Supplies , at para 90, that \u201cif damage is an ingredient of the cause of \naction a representative claim could not be maintained\u201d. The Court of Appeal in Emerald Supplies  did not doubt the correctness of the Prudential  decision, where a \nrepresentative claim was allowed to proceed although damage was an ingredient of the cause of action. As Professor Rachael Mulheron, a leading expert in this field, has \npersuasively argued, it should likewise have been possible in Emerald Supplies  to adopt \na bifurcated process in which the questions whether prices had been inflated by \nagreements or concerted practices and whether passing  on was in principle available \nas a defence were decided in a representative action. If successful, this action could then have formed the basis for further proceedings to prove the fact and amount of \ndamage in individual cases: see Mulheron R, \u201c Emerald Supplies Ltd v British Airways \nplc; A Century Later, The Ghost of Markt  Lives On\u201d [2009] Comp Law 159, 171.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f91ea678-497f-465b-a13c-22cec89bfb48": {"__data__": {"id_": "f91ea678-497f-465b-a13c-22cec89bfb48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1d992a7e-bf42-4fc7-b295-63ed93c4de71", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "0a4bbba2d1eb5668bb62c028604da72053da051a21b9c51940e0f0973c7391b8"}}, "hash": "f88639dcb4f80063dedb08d83081ae90f54d86f43fd5767d4cbf890c95a64d6a", "text": "Page 23 \n \n (f) Commonwealth cases  \n59.

In Western Canadian Shopping Centres Inc v Dutton [2001] 2 SCR 534, par as 38 -\n48, the Supreme Court of Canada held that representative actions should be allowed \nto proceed where the following conditions are met: (1) the class is capable of clear \ndefinition; (2) there are issues of fact or law common to all class members; (3) s uccess \nfor one class member means success for all (although not necessarily to the same extent); and (4) the proposed representative adequately represents the interests of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2de6685-f0a1-4152-882d-b72044724d8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2de6685-f0a1-4152-882d-b72044724d8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1254ccea-5ff6-4957-b0ba-79eade261399", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "2a5cc6da2e2e08b08e8ce6b480c544b2d6ae30e6e143c48a23899e2038f91270"}}, "hash": "bab85ba91709ae261d0775164a9d304377de2384c86ca9494fd96c547c7955e3", "text": "Page 24 \n \n the class. If these conditions are met the court must also be satisfied, in the exer cise of \nits discretion, that there are no countervailing considerations that outweigh the \nbenefits of allowing the representative action to proceed. The Supreme Court held that \nthe conditions were met by the claimants in Dutton , who sued as representatives  of a \ngroup of investors complaining that the defendant had breached fiduciary duties to the \ninvestors by mismanaging their funds.  \n62. Giving the judgment of the court, McLachlin CJ, at para 47, distinguished its \nearlier decision in General Motors of Canada Lt d v Naken [1983] 1 SCR 72, where a \nrepresentative action had been disallowed. In Naken  the action was brought on behalf \nof purchasers of new Firenza motor vehicles against the manufacturer, complaining \nthat the quality of the vehicles had been misrepresented or was not as warranted in \nadvertisements, other published materials and contracts which were partly oral and \npartly written. Damages were claimed limited to $1,000 per person. The claims were held to be unsuitable for resolution through a representative action, principally \nbecause determining both liability and damages would have requir ed particularised \nevidence and fact -finding in relation to each individual purchaser.  \n63. McLachlin CJ also commented, at para 46, that over the period since Naken  was \ndecided the benefits of class actions had become manifest. She identified, at paras 27-29, t hree important advantages which such actions offer over a multiplicity of \nindividual suits: (1) avoiding unnecessary duplication in fact -finding and legal analysis; \n(2) making economical the prosecution of claims that would otherwise be too costly to \nprose cute individually; and (3) serving efficiency and justice by ensuring that actual \nand potential wrongdoers who cause widespread but individually minimal harm take \ninto account the full costs of their conduct.  \n64. McLachlin CJ further observed, at para 34, that , while it would clearly be \nadvantageous if there existed a comprehensive legislative framework regulating class actions, in its absence \u201cthe courts must fill the void\u201d.  \n(iii) New Zealand  \n65. The Supreme Court of New Zealand has recently considered the use of the \nrepresentative procedure in Southern Response Earthquake Services Ltd v Ross  [2020] \nNZSC 126. This was a representative action brought on behalf of some 3,000 \npolicyholders who had settled insurance claims for damage to their homes caused by \nearthquake s in the Canterbury region of New Zealand. The claimants alleged that the \npolicyholders had been misled by the insurers about the cost of remedying the \ndamage, with the result that they had settled their claims on a less favourable basis", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbf3dca8-37c1-463b-a5a7-06a06a124432": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbf3dca8-37c1-463b-a5a7-06a06a124432", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "50322f66-ed1e-4924-8014-ea8ed9a56db9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "d162ad806637a56f547987b84e50f2e3a36572ed0f4ef3572ea7ab4fa69c0c72"}}, "hash": "15774ea84fd7d3fb3facee10a0f06958335a949bc277421f450c894306e1583a", "text": "Page 25 \n \n than otherwise would have been the case. The insurers did not oppose the action \nbeing brought on a representative basis, but argued that the class represented should \nbe limited to policyholders who completed a form electing to opt into the proceedings. \nIt was agreed that the proceedings would need to be heard in two stages. The first \nstage would deal with issues common to all members of the represented class. If the \nclaimants succeeded at that stage in whole or in part, there would need to be a second \nstage, in which questio ns of relief were addressed. It was also agreed that, at the \nsecond stage, it would be necessary for all of the policyholders represented to take \nactive steps -  that is, to opt in -  if they wished to establish their individual claims. \n66. The New Zealand Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal \nthat the claim should be allowed to continue on an opt out basis. In doing so, the \nSupreme Court rejected an argument that it should not develop an opt out regime in \nthe absence of a statutory framework  and gave guidance on various matters relating to \nsupervision of opt out representative proceedings.  \n(g) Principles governing use of the representative procedure \n67. Although the world has changed out of all recognition since the representative \nprocedure was devised by the Court of Chancery, it has done so in ways which have made the problems to which the procedure provided a solution more common and \noften vastly bigger in scale. The mass production of goods and mass provision of \nservices have had the result th at, when legally culpable conduct occurs, a very large \ngroup of people, sometimes numbering in the millions, may be affected. As the \npresent case illustrates, the development of digital technologies has added to the \npotential for mass harm for which legal redress may be sought. In such cases it is \nnecessary to reconcile, on the one hand, the inconvenience or complete impracticality of litigating multiple individual claims with, on the other hand, the inconvenience or \ncomplete impracticality of making every prospective claimant (or defendant) a party to \na single claim. The only practical way to \u201ccome at justice\u201d is to combine the claims in a \nsingle proceeding and allow one or more persons to represent all others who share the \nsame interest in the outcome. When trying all the individual claims is not feasible, the \nadages of Lord Eldon quoted by Lord Macnaghten in Ellis remain as pertinent as ever: \nthat it is better to go as far as possible towards justice than to deny it altogether and \nthat, if you cannot reali stically make everybody interested a party, you should ensure \nthat those who are parties will \u201cfairly and honestly try the right\u201d.  \n68. I agree with the highest courts of Australia, Canada and New Zealand that, while \na detailed legislative framework would be pr eferable, its absence (outside the field of \ncompetition law) in this country is no reason to decline to apply, or to interpret \nrestrictively, the representative rule which has long existed (and has had a legislative", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a4ee483-ca70-4763-9ae6-f7578daf3745": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a4ee483-ca70-4763-9ae6-f7578daf3745", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f44ccc2c-82f9-447c-b049-b1daeef55c17", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "b17e89b3dfe1e5419172fdb1af00f2a41fff9ecf5b3b4797910fa4fb7863cfa4"}}, "hash": "df94a7997719cbec04ff0619974adac107cba7a92bbeffd3d6f33515ffb98e9f", "text": "Page 26 \n \n basis since 1873). I also agree with the view expressed in Carnie  that the very simplicity \nof the representative rule is in some respects a strength, allowing it to be treated as \u201ca \nflexible tool of convenience in the administration of justice\u201d and \u201capplied to the exigencies of modern life as oc casion requires\u201d.  \n(i) The \u201csame interest\u201d requirement  \n69. In its current form in CPR rule 19.6 the rule imposes no limit (either as a \nminimum or maximum) on the number of people who may be represented. Only one \ncondition must be satisfied before a representati ve claim may be begun or allowed to \ncontinue: that is, that the representative has \u201cthe same interest\u201d in the claim as the \nperson(s) represented.  \n70. The phrase \u201cthe same interest\u201d is capable of bearing a range of meanings and \nrequires interpretation. In inter preting the phrase, reference has often been made to \nLord Macnaghten\u2019s statement in Ellis (quoted at para 38 above) that: \u201cGiven a \ncommon interest and a common grievance, a representative suit was in order if the \nrelief sought was in its nature beneficial to all whom the plaintiff proposed to \nrepresent.\u201d This statement has sometimes been treated as if it were a definition \nimposing a tripartite test: see eg Smith v Cardiff Corpn  [1954] 1 QB 210. Such an \napproach seems to me misguided. It is clear from the co ntext that Lord Macnaghten \nwas not attempting to define \u201cthe same interest\u201d, but to convey how limiting the rule \nto persons having a beneficial proprietary interest in the claim would be contrary to \nthe old practice in the Court of Chancery. More profoundl y, such a reading of Lord \nMacnaghten\u2019s speech shows precisely the rigidity of approach to the application of the \nrepresentative rule which he disparaged.  \n71. The phrase \u201cthe same interest\u201d, as it is used in the representative rule, needs to \nbe interpreted purposively in light of the overriding objective of the civil procedure \nrules and the rationale for the representative procedure. The premise for a \nrepresentative action is that claims are capable of being brought by (or against) a \nnumber of people which raise a common issue (or issues): hence the potential and \nmotivation for a judgment which binds them all. The purpose of requiring the \nrepresentative to have \u201cthe same interest\u201d in the claim as the persons represented is \nto ensure that the representative can be relied on to conduct the litigation in a way \nwhich will effectively promote and protect the interests of all the members of the \nrepresented class. That plainly is not possible where there is a conflict of interest \nbetween class members, in that an argumen t which would advance the cause of some \nwould prejudice the position of others. Markt  and Emerald Supplies  are both examples \nof cases where it was found that the proposed representative action, as formulated, \ncould not be maintained for this reason.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bee98c9f-08d1-4bad-8a3d-a9e5571457d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "bee98c9f-08d1-4bad-8a3d-a9e5571457d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "41289757-f5e6-4d8f-b909-2bb418706b05", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "02d21e822d5423e68423cbe7d3aa03d1d0cc24f824ff7efd738dfde67c167a32"}}, "hash": "91133f79ec14acf69eabbb5a2994579e5deb02d1e32ae934cb6b96c6d9c6f4e3", "text": "Page 27 \n \n 72. As Pro fessor Adrian Zuckerman has observed in his valuable book on civil \nprocedure, however, a distinction needs to be drawn between cases where there are \nconflicting interests between class members and cases where there are merely \ndivergent interests, in that a n issue arises or may well arise in relation to the claims of \n(or against) some class members but not others. So long as advancing the case of class members affected by the issue would not prejudice the position of others, there is no \nreason in principle w hy all should not be represented by the same person: see \nZuckerman on Civil Procedure: Principles of Practice , 4th ed (2021), para 13.49. As \nProfessor Zuckerman also points out, concerns which may once have existed about \nwhether the representative party co uld be relied on to pursue vigorously lines of \nargument not directly applicable to their individual case are misplaced in the modern context, where the reality is that proceedings brought to seek collective redress are \nnot normally conducted and controlled by the nominated representative, but rather \nare typically driven and funded by lawyers or commercial litigation funders with the \nrepresentative party merely acting as a figurehead. In these circumstances, there is no \nreason why a representative party cannot properly represent the interests of all \nmembers of the class, provided there is no true conflict of interest between them.  \n73. This purposive and pragmatic interpretation of the requirement is exemplified \nby The \u201cIrish Rowan\u201d , where Staughton LJ, at pp 227- 228, noted that some of the \ninsurers might wish to resist the claim on a ground that was not available to others. He \nrightly d id not regard that circumstance as showing that all the insurers did not have \n\u201cthe same interest\u201d in the action, or that it was not within the rule, and had \u201cno \nqualms about a proceeding which allows that ground to be argued on their behalf by \nothers\u201d.  \n74. Even if it were considered inconsistent with the \u201csame interest\u201d requirement, or \notherwise inappropriate, for a single person to represent two groups of people in \nrelation to whom different issues arise although there is no conflict of interest \nbetween them, any procedural objection could be overcome by bringing two (or more) \nrepresentative claims, each with a separate representative claimant or defendant, and \ncombining them in the same action.  \n(ii) The court\u2019s discretion \n75. Where the same interest requirement is  satisfied, the court has a discretion \nwhether to allow a claim to proceed as a representative action. As with any power \ngiven to it by the Civil Procedure Rules, the court must in exercising its discretion seek \nto give effect to the overriding objective o f dealing with cases justly and at \nproportionate cost: see CPR rule 1.2(a). Many of the considerations specifically included in that objective (see CPR rule 1.1(2)) -  such as ensuring that the parties are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0cade8fb-a4cf-4f83-be20-2048b92aff7e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0cade8fb-a4cf-4f83-be20-2048b92aff7e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9baad637-b477-48c8-81b3-6397ca3863c8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "68aba8501a1d9f30c9740804ce68422069b0ef5d87c71a145f8c3a44714ccbd7"}}, "hash": "4f273a5ce37b58ffd3d526c2c7046c642101fa4dfd2d0fe29b79a3f3da39c55e", "text": "Page 28 \n \n on an equal footing, saving expense, dealing with t he case in ways which are \nproportionate to the amount of money involved, ensuring that the case is dealt with \nexpeditiously and fairly, and allotting to it an appropriate share of the court\u2019s \nresources while taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases - are \nlikely to militate in favour of allowing a claim, where practicable, to be continued as a representative action rather than leaving members of the class to pursue claims \nindividually.  \n76. Four further features of the representative rule deserve mention.  \n(iii) No requirement of consent  \n77. First, as the ability to act as a representative under the rule does not depend on \nthe consent of the persons represented but only on community of interest between \nthem, there is ordinarily no need for a member of the represented class to take any \npositive step, or even to be aware of the existence of the action, in order to be bound \nby the result. The rule does not confer a right to opt out of the proceedings (though a \nperson could, at least in theory, apply t o the court for a direction under rule 19.6(3) \nthat the named claimant (or defendant) may not represent them or under rule 19.6(4) that any judgment given will not be binding on them). It is, however, always open to \nthe judge managing the case to impose a requirement to notify members of the class \nof the proceedings and establish a simple procedure for opting out of representation, if \nthis is considered desirable. Equally, if there are circumstances which make it \nappropriate to limit the represented class t o persons who have positively opted into \nthe litigation, it is open to the judge to make this a condition of representation. The \nprocedure is entirely flexible in these respects.  \n(iv) The class definition \n78. Second, while it is plainly desirable that the clas s of persons represented should \nbe clearly defined, the adequacy of the definition is a matter which goes to the court\u2019s \ndiscretion in deciding whether it is just and convenient to allow the claim to be \ncontinued on a representative basis rather than being  a precondition for the \napplication of the rule. Emerald Supplies  illustrates a general principle that \nmembership of the class should not depend on the outcome of the litigation. Beyond \nthat, whether or to what extent any practical difficulties in identify ing the members of \nthe class are material must depend on the nature and object of the proceedings. In Duke of Bedford v Ellis , for example, it did not matter that the number and identities of \ngrowers of fruit etc would have been difficult if not impossible  to ascertain or that the \nclass was a fluctuating one: given that the aim was to establish whether anyone who", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d82a69a-00cd-4838-b202-16715afdeada": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d82a69a-00cd-4838-b202-16715afdeada", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "593337c6-3296-466f-957b-8b9f31d53fb2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "d6acfaaf4c3899dd2979adc1af4f4ccaa3cb8f7237b2cfc92892f6a3795aa094"}}, "hash": "22acccae5b8eaca8a52c147238d478d55cd440265dd64926ed55ad44036d5f8e", "text": "Page 29 \n \n was a grower had preferential rights, all that mattered was that there would be no real \ndifficulty in determining whether a particular person who claimed a preferential right \nto a vacant stand at Covent Garden was a grower or not: see [1901] AC 1 at 11. In \nsome cases, however, for example where the viability of a claim for damages depends \non demonstrating the size of the class or who its members are , such practical \ndifficulties might well be significant.  \n(v) Liability for costs  \n79. Third, as persons represented by a representative claimant or defendant will \nnot normally themselves have been joined as parties to the claim, they will not \nordinarily be liab le to pay any costs incurred by the representative in pursuing (or \ndefending) the claim. That does not prevent the court, if it is in the interests of justice \nto do so, from making an order requiring a represented person to pay or contribute to costs and g iving permission for the order to be enforced against that person pursuant \nto CPR rule 19.6(4)(b). Alternatively, such an order could be made pursuant to the general jurisdiction of the court to make costs orders against non- parties. It is difficult, \nhowever, to envisage circumstances in which it could be just to order a represented person to contribute to costs incurred by a claimant in bringing a representative claim \nwhich the represented person did not authorise. On the other hand, a commercial \nlitigatio n funder who finances unsuccessful proceedings is likely to be ordered to pay \nthe successful party\u2019s costs at least to the extent of the funding: see Davey v Money  \n[2020] EWCA Civ 246; [2020] 1 WLR 1751. That principle is no less applicable where the \nproce edings financed are a representative action.  \n(vi) The scope for claiming damages  \n80. Finally, as already discussed, it is not a bar to a representative claim that each \nrepresented person has in law a separate cause of action nor that the relief claimed consists of or includes damages or some other monetary relief. The potential for \nclaiming damages in a representative action is, however, limited by the nature of the \nremedy of damages at common law. What limits the scope for claiming damages in \nrepresentative pr oceedings is the compensatory principle on which damages for a civil \nwrong are awarded with the object of putting the claimant -  as an individual - in the \nsame position, as best money can do it, as if the wrong had not occurred. In the \nordinary course, thi s necessitates an individualised assessment which raises no \ncommon issue and cannot fairly or effectively be carried out without the participation in the proceedings of the individuals concerned. A representative action is therefore \nnot a suitable vehicle for such an exercise.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93e623a6-0054-4e7d-8b39-cf809aa70070": {"__data__": {"id_": "93e623a6-0054-4e7d-8b39-cf809aa70070", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "73be774d-2ba2-4c4c-ad2c-88f261394488", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "8c09dbd19caf91e5cb22764fa89e8720ef90b441966dd883d4ef320b2583145e"}}, "hash": "e11c7486549c4884a174ebb7accbd7a7ca40ce63f81e6ceea0cc43e6e65dba8d", "text": "Page 30 \n \n 81. In cases where damages would require individual assessment, there may \nnevertheless be advantages in terms of justice and efficiency in adopting a bifurcated \nprocess -  as was done, for example, in the Prudential  case -  whereby common i ssues of \nlaw or fact are decided through a representative claim, leaving any issues which require individual determination -  whether they relate to liability or the amount of \ndamages -  to be dealt with at a subsequent stage of the proceedings. In Prudentia l \n[1981] Ch 229,  255, Vinelott J expressed the view (obiter) that time would continue to \nrun for the purpose of limitation until individual claims for damages were brought by the persons represented; see also the dicta of Fletcher Moulton LJ in Markt  [1910] 2 KB \n1021, 1042, referred to at para 44 above. The court in Prudential  did not have cited to \nit, however, the decision of the Court of Appeal in Moon v Atherton [1972] 2 QB 435. In \nthat case a represented person applied to be substituted for the named cl aimant after \nthe limitation period had expired when the claimant (and all the other represented \npersons) no longer wished to continue the action. The Court of Appeal, in allowing the \nsubstitution, held that the defendant was not thereby deprived of a limit ation defence, \nas for the purpose of limitation the represented person was already a party to the action, albeit not a \u201cfull\u201d party. It might be clearer to say that, although the \nrepresented person did not become a \u201cparty\u201d until substituted as the claimant , an \naction was brought within the meaning of the statute of limitation by that person when the representative claim was initiated. Such an analysis has been adopted in \nAustralia, including by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Fostif Pty Ltd v \nCampbel ls Cash & Carry Pty Ltd  [2005] NSWCA 83; (2005) 63 NSWLR 203, and by the \nNew Zealand Supreme Court in Credit Suisse Private Equity v Houghton  [2014] NZSC 37.  \n82. There is no reason why damages or other monetary remedies cannot be \nclaimed in a representative ac tion if the entitlement can be calculated on a basis that is \ncommon to all the members of the class. Counsel for the claimant, Hugh Tomlinson \nQC, gave the example of a claim alleging that every member of the class was wrongly \ncharged a fixed fee; another example might be a claim alleging that all the class \nmembers acquired the same product with the same defect which reduced its value by \nthe same amount. In such cases the defendant\u2019s monetary liability could be \ndetermined as a common issue and no individuali sed assessment would be needed. \nThe same is true where loss suffered by the class as a whole can be calculated without reference to the losses suffered by individual class members -  as in the cases \nmentioned at para 53 above. Such an assessment of loss on a global basis is sometimes described as a \u201ctop down\u201d approach, in contrast to a \u201cbottom up\u201d approach of assessing a sum which each member of the class is individually entitled to recover.  \n83. The recovery of money in a representative action on either basis may give rise \nto problems of distribution to the members of the class, about which the \nrepresentative rule is silent.

THE REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM IN THIS CASE  \n84. In the present case I could see no legitimate objection to a representative claim \nbrought to establish whether Google was in breach of the DPA 1998 and, if so, seeking \na declaration that any member of the represented class who has suffered damage by reason of the breach is entitled to be paid compensation. The individual claims that \ncould theoretically have been brought by each i Phone user who was affected by the \nSafari workaround clearly raise common issues; and it is not suggested that there is any conflict of interest among the members of the represented class. For the purpose \nof CPR rule 19.6(1), all would therefore have the s ame interest in such a claim as the \nrepresentative claimant. There is no suggestion that Mr Lloyd is an unsuitable person to act in that capacity. Although Google has argued that there would be practical \ndifficulties in identifying whether an individual falls within the class definition, even on \nGoogle\u2019s evidence it is evident that the number of people affected by the Safari \nworkaround was extremely large and it is unclear at this stage of the litigation how serious the difficulties of proof would actually be. Moreover, even if only a few \nindividuals were ultimately able to obtain compensation on the basis of a declaratory judgment, I cannot see why that should provide a reason for refusing to allow a \nrepresentative claim to proceed for the purpose of establ ishing liability.  \n85. The claimant has not proposed such a bifurcated process, however. That is \ndoubtless because success in the first, representative stage of such a process would \nnot itself generate any financial return for the litigation funders or the pers ons \nrepresented. Funding the proceedings could therefore only be economic if pursuing \nseparate damages claims on behalf of those individuals who opted into the second \nstage of the process would be economic. For the reasons discussed at paras 25- 28 \nabove and emphasised in argument by counsel for the claimant, it clearly would not.

In formulating the claim made in this action, the claimant has not adopted the \n\u201ctop down\u201d approach of claiming compensation for damage suffered by the class as a \nwhole without reference to the entitlements of individual class members. The claim \nadvanced is for damages calculated from the \u201cbottom up\u201d. The way in which the \nclaimant seeks to obviate the need for individualised assessment is by claiming damages for each class member on what is described as a \u201cuniform per capita basis\u201d.  \n87. The difficulty fa cing this approach is that the effect of the Safari workaround \nwas obviously not uniform across the represented class. No challenge is or could \nreasonably be made to the judge\u2019s findings, at [2018] EWHC 2599 (QB); [2019] 1 WLR \n1265, para 91, that:  \n\u201c\u2026 some affected individuals were \u2018super users\u2019 - heavy \ninternet users. They will have been \u2018victims\u2019 of multiple \nbreaches, with considerable amounts of [browser generated \ninformation] taken and used throughout the Relevant Period. \nOthers will have engaged in very  little internet activity. \nDifferent individuals will have had different kinds of information taken and used.

Furthermore, the amount of any compensation recoverable by any member of the \nclass would depend on a variety of circumstances particular to that individual. \nIndividualised assessment of damages would therefore be required.  \n88.

The term \u201cmaterial damage\u201d is sometimes used to \ndescribe any financial loss or physical or psychological injury, but excluding distress (or \nother negative emotions not amounting to a recognised psychiatric illness): see eg \nWatkins v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2006] UKHL 17; [200 6] 2 AC \n395, para 7. Adopting this terminology, on a straightforward interpretation the term \u201cdamage\u201d in section 13 refers only to material damage and compensation can only be recovered for distress if either of the two conditions set out in subsection (2) is met.  \n(3) Vidal -Hall v Google Inc  \n93. The effect of section 13 was considered by the Court of Appeal in Vidal -Hall v \nGoogle  Inc [2016] QB 1003 on facts which, in terms of the generic allegations made, \nwere identical to those on which the present claim is based. The three claimants \nsought damages arising out of the Safari workaround on two alternative bases: (1) at \ncommon law for misuse of private information; and (2) under section 13 of the DPA \n1998. As in the present case, permission to serve the proceedings outside the \njurisdiction was opposed by Google. The main issues raised were: (1) whether misuse \nof private information is a tort for the purpose of the rules providing for service out of \nthe jurisdiction; and (2) whether compensation can be recovered for distress under \nsection 13 of the DPA 1998 in the absence of financial loss. The judge decided both \nissues in the claimants\u2019 f avour and the Court of Appeal affirmed that decision, for \nreasons given in a judgment written by Lord Dyson MR and Sharp LJ, with which \nMacfarlane LJ agreed.  \n94. On the second issue Google submitted that, as discussed above, the term \n\u201cdamage\u201d in section 13 mus t mean material damage, which for practical purposes \nlimits its scope to financial loss. Hence section 13(2) has the effect that an individual \nmay only recover compensation for distress suffered by reason of a contravention by a \ndata controller of a requir ement of the Act if either (a) the contravention also causes \nthe individual to suffer financial loss or (b) the contravention relates to the processing \nof personal data for \u201cspecial purposes\u201d -  which are defined as journalistic, artistic or \nliterary purpos es (see section 3). It was not alleged that either of those conditions was \nsatisfied in the Vidal -Hall case.  \n95. The Court of Appeal accepted that section 13(2) does indeed have this meaning \nbut held that this makes it incompatible with article 23 of the Data Protection \nDirective, which section 13 of the DPA 1998 was meant to implement. This is because \nthe word \u201cdamage\u201d in article 23 is to be interpreted as including distress, which is the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "47317855-3400-4e07-b3d7-23a0a5b11cba": {"__data__": {"id_": "47317855-3400-4e07-b3d7-23a0a5b11cba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "35b47e9a-0cb6-4456-8197-f8f3471bc714", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "2cf3f04e8599c0211348668ca773d45841df85b2bb9a96a3d616c59617c2bc04"}}, "hash": "5f47e0967697b754d6c56551a2e1f3306589ec250ea28be4dd52ef67f47ebd8c", "text": "Page 36 \n \n primary form of damage likely to be caused by an invasion of data privac y; and article \n23 does not permit national laws to restrict the right to receive compensation for \n\u201cdamage\u201d where it takes the form of distress. The Court of Appeal considered whether \nit is possible to interpret section 13 in a way which achieves the result sought by the \nDirective , but concluded that the words of section 13 are not capable of being \ninterpreted in such a way and that the limits set by Parliament to the right to compensation for breaches of the DPA 1998 are a fundamental feature of the UK \nlegislative scheme. In the words of Lord Dyson MR and Sharp LJ in their joint judgment, \nat para 93, if the court were to disapply the limits on the right to compensation for \ndistress set out in section 13(2), \u201cthe court would, in effect, be legislating against  the \nclearly expressed intention of Parliament on an issue that was central to the scheme as \na whole\u201d.  \n96. The Court of Appeal nevertheless held that section 13(2) should be disapplied \non the ground that it conflicts with articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental \nRights of the European Union (\u201cthe EU Charter\u201d). Article 7 of the EU Charter is in \nmaterially similar terms to article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of \nHuman Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) and provides that \n\u201c[e]veryone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and \ncommunications\u201d. Article 8(1) provides that \u201c[e]veryone has the right to the protection \nof personal data concerning him or her\u201d. In addition, article 47 requires that \n\u201c[e]v eryone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by the law of the Union are \nviolated has the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal \u2026\u201d. The Court of Appeal \ndecided that, in order to provide an effective remedy for the rights guaranteed by \narticles 7 an d 8 of the EU Charter, it was necessary that national law should give effect \nto the obligation under article 23 of the Data Protection Directive to provide a right to \nreceive compensation from the data controller for any damage, including distress, \nsuffere d as a result of an unlawful processing operation. That result could and should \nbe achieved by disapplying section 13(2) of the DPA 1998, thus enabling section 13(1) \nto be interpreted compatibly with article 23: see [2016] QB 1003, para 105.  \n(4) Misuse of private information  \n97. The Court of Appeal in Vidal -Hall also held that the claims for damages for \nmisuse of private information made by the claimants in that case were properly \nclassified as claims in tort for the purpose of service out of the jurisdiction a nd had a \nreal prospect of success. As described at paras 18- 25 of the judgment, the tort of \nmisuse of private information evolved out of the equitable action for breach of \nconfidence, influenced by the protection of the right to respect for private life guaranteed by article 8 of the Convention.

The newspapers admitted liability for breach of \nprivacy but disputed the amount of damages. Their main argument of principle was \nthat (in the absence of material damage) all that could be compensated for was \ndistress caused by their unlawful activities: see [2016] FSR 12, para 108. The judge rejected that argument. He said, at para 111, that he did not see why \u201cdistress (or \nsome similar emotion), which would admittedly  be a likely consequence of an invasion \nof privacy, should be the only touchstone for damages\u201d. In his view:  \n\u201cWhile the law is used to awarding damages for injured \nfeelings, there is no reason in principle \u2026 why it should not \nalso make an award to reflect infringements of the right \nitself, if the situation warrants it.\u201d \n101. The judge referred to cases in which damages have been awarded to very young \nchildren (only ten months or one year old) for misuse of private information by \npublishing photographs of them even though, because of their age, they could not \nhave suffered any distress: see AAA v Associated Newspapers Ltd [2012] EWHC 2103 \n(QB); [2013] EMLR 2; and Weller v Associated Newspapers Ltd  [2014] EWHC 1163 (QB); \n[2014] EMLR 24. He concluded, at para 144:  \n\u201cI shall therefore approach the consideration of quantum in \nthis case on the footing that compensation can be given for \nthings other than distress, and in particular can be given for \nthe commission of the wrong itself so far as that commission \nimpacts on th e values protected by the right.\u201d  \nLater in the judgment, at para 168, the judge referred back to his finding that:", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c5683917-aed6-4375-be53-1f3c86e4d298": {"__data__": {"id_": "c5683917-aed6-4375-be53-1f3c86e4d298", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e3e33c1-580d-4940-ae35-0e1ed2e0ee1c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "a32f23bd552a782edfc46fc238a4b1a5339f1c04a6a011c953add8e813aed91a"}}, "hash": "ec8fb91894f37d01a1d461b33ce905908d80958a03c90a3cc42483eb456b9cd3", "text": "Page 39 \n \n \u201cthe damages should compensate not merely for distress \u2026, \nbut should also compensate (if appropriate) for the loss of \nprivacy or autonomy as such arising out [of] the infringement by hacking (or other mechanism) as such.\u201d  \n102. The Court of Appeal affirmed this decision: [2015] EWCA Civ 1291; [2017] QB \n149. Arden LJ (with whom Rafferty and Kitchin LJJ agreed) held, at para 45, that:  \n\u201cthe judge was co rrect to conclude that the power of the \ncourt to grant general damages was not limited to distress and could be exercised to compensate the claimants also for \nthe misuse of their private information. The essential \nprinciple is that, by misusing their priva te information, MGN \ndeprived the claimants of their right to control the use of private information.\u201d  \nArden LJ justified this conclusion, at para 46, on the basis that:  \n\u201cPrivacy is a fundamental right. The reasons for having the right are no doubt manifold. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead put \nit very succinctly in Campbell v MGN Ltd  [2004] 2 AC 457, \npara 12: \u2018[Privacy] lies at the heart of liberty in a modern state. A proper degree of privacy is essential for the well -\nbeing and development of an individual.\u2019\u201d  \n103. The Court of Appeal in Gulati rejected a submission, also rejected by the judge, \nthat granting damages for the fact of intrusion into a person\u2019s privacy independently of \nany distress caused is inconsistent with the holding of this court in R (WL (Congo)) v \nSecretary of State for the Home Department  [2011] UKSC 12; [2012] 1 AC 245, paras \n97-100, that vindicatory damages are not available as a remedy for violation of a \nprivate right.

On the basis of the decisions of the Court of Appeal in Vidal -Hall and Gulati , \nneither of which is challenged by either party on this appeal, it would be open to Mr \nLloyd to claim, at least in his own right: (1) damages under section 13(1) of the DPA 1998 for any distress suffered by reason of any contravention by Google of any of the \nrequirements of the Act; and/or (2) damages for the m isuse of private information \nwithout the need to show that it caused any material damage or distress.  \n106. Neither of these claims, however, is made in this case. The reasons why no \nclaim is made in tort for misuse of private information have not been explained; but \nthe view may have been taken that, to establish a reasonable expectation of privacy, it \nwould be necessary to adduce evidence of facts particular to each individual claimant. \nIn Vidal -Hall, the claimants produced confidential schedules about their in ternet use, \nshowing that the information tracked and collected by Google in their cases was, in the \nCourt of Appeal\u2019s words at [2016] QB 1003, para 137, \u201coften of an extremely private \nnature\u201d. As discussed earlier, the need to obtain evidence in relation t o individual \nmembers of the represented class would be incompatible with the representative \nclaim which Mr Lloyd is seeking to bring.  \n107. Similarly, to recover damages for distress under section 13(1) of the DPA 1998 \nwould require evidence of such distress fro m each individual for whom such a claim \nwas made. Again, this would be incompatible with claiming damages on a representative basis.  \n108. Instead of making either of these potential claims, the claimant seeks to break \nnew legal ground by arguing that the princi ples identified in Gulati as applicable to the \nassessment of damages for misuse of private information at common law also apply to \nthe assessment of compensation under section 13(1) of the DPA 1998.

There is potential for confusion in the use of this description. \u201cLoss of control\u201d is \nnot an expression used in the DPA 1998 and, as the third interveners (the Association \nof the British Pharmaceutical Industry and Association of British HealthTech Industries) \npoint ed out in their helpful written submissions, none of the requirements of the Act is \npredicated on \u201ccontrol\u201d over personal data by the data subject. Under the legislative scheme the relevant control is that of the data controller: the entity which \n\u201cdetermin es the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal data are, or \nare to be, processed.\u201d The nearest analogue to control as regards the data subject is \nhis or her \u201cconsent to the processing\u201d, being the first condition in Schedule 2 (see para 22 above). Such consent, however, is neither necessary nor sufficient to render the \nprocessing of personal data compliant with the Act.  \n110. It was made clear in submissions, however, that, in describing the basis for the \ncompensation claimed as \u201closs of control\u201d o f personal data, the claimant is not seeking \nto single out a particular category of breaches of the DPA 1998 by a data controller as \nbreaches in respect of which the data subject is entitled to compensation without \nproof of material damage or distress. The claimant\u2019s case, which was accepted by the \nCourt of Appeal, is that an individual is entitled to recover compensation under section \n13 of the DPA 1998 without proof of material damage or distress whenever a data \ncontroller fails to comply with any of the requirements of the Act in relation to any \npersonal data of which that individual is the subject, provided only that the \ncontravention is not trivial or de minimis. Any such contravention, on the claimant\u2019s \ncase, ipso facto involves \u201closs of control\u201d of da ta for which compensation is payable. \nOnly where the individual claiming compensation is not the data subject is it necessary on the claimant\u2019s case to show that the individual has suffered material damage or distress.  \n(8) The common source argument \n111. The claimant\u2019s core argument for this interpretation is that, as a matter of \nprinciple, the same approach to the damage for which compensation can be awarded should apply under the data protection legislation as where the claim is brought in tort \nfor misuse of private information because the two claims, although not coterminous, \nhave a common source.

Second, the logic of the argument by \nanalogy is in any event flawed.  \n(a) The wording of the DPA 1998  \n114. I do not accept a submission made by counsel for Google that the interpretation \nof section 13 of the DPA 1998 should be approached on the basis of a general rul e that \nbreaches of statutory duty are not actionable without proof of material damage. The \nquestion in Cullen v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary  [2003] UKHL 39; \n[2003] 1 WLR 1763, relied on to support this submission, was whether a statute which did not expressly confer a right to compensation on a person affected by a breach of \nstatutory duty nevertheless conferred such a right impliedly. That is not the question \nraised in this case, where there is an express entitlement to compensation pro vided by \nsection 13 of the DPA 1998. The only question in this case is what the words of the \nrelevant statutory provision mean.  \n115. Those words, however, cannot reasonably be interpreted as giving an individual \na right to compensation without proof of material  damage or distress whenever a data \ncontroller commits a non -trivial breach of any requirement of the Act in relation to any \npersonal data of which that individual is the subject. In the first place, as discussed \nabove, the wording of section 13(1) draws a distinction between \u201cdamage\u201d suffered by \nan individual and a \u201ccontravention\u201d of a requirement of the Act by a data controller, and provides a right to compensation \u201cfor that damage\u201d only if the \u201cdamage\u201d occurs \n\u201cby reason of\u201d the contravention. This wordin g is inconsistent with an entitlement to \ncompensation based solely on proof of the contravention. To say, as the claimant does \nin its written case, that what is \u201cdamaged\u201d is the data subject\u2019s right to have their data \nprocessed in accordance with the requi rements of the Act does not meet this point, as \nit amounts to an acknowledgement that on the claimant\u2019s case the damage and the \ncontravention are one and the same.  \n116. Nor is the claimant\u2019s case assisted by section 14 of the DPA 1998, on which \nreliance is plac ed. Section 14(1) gives the court power, on the application of a data \nsubject, to order a data controller to rectify, block, erase or destroy personal data if \nsatisfied that the data are inaccurate. Section 14(4) states:  \n\u201cIf a court is satisfied on the app lication of a data subject -", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c239a5fd-d590-4591-aadf-3e4379c05256": {"__data__": {"id_": "c239a5fd-d590-4591-aadf-3e4379c05256", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ac46d740-063a-4b5f-95bb-51a05bae96ce", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "ab1c20a37ec84f4d74ffc56ef21e62820b7d12d7053dff5423910b11466b8b28"}}, "hash": "61904345c79c1cbe23a86c25efc857fbc9647fa5aaa42ef9a52b7736b243d880", "text": "Page 44 \n \n (a) that he has suffered damage by reason of any \ncontravention by a data controller of any of the \nrequirements of this Act in respect of any personal \ndata, in circumstances entitling him to compensation \nunder section 13, and  \n(b) that there is a substantial risk of further \ncontravention in respect of those data in such circumstances,  \nthe court may order the rectification, blocking, erasure or \ndestruction of any of those data.\u201d  \n117. Counsel for the claimant submitted that, if Google\u2019s case on what is meant by \n\u201cdamage\u201d is correct, a data subject who does not suffer material damage or distress as \na result of a breach of duty by a data controller cannot claim rectification, blocking, \nerasure or destruction of data, unless those data are in accurate, however egregious \nthe breach. This is true, but I can see nothing unreasonable in such a result. Indeed, \nsection 14 seems to me positively to confirm that \u201cdamage\u201d means something distinct \nfrom a contravention of the Act itself. If a contraventio n by a data controller of the Act \ncould by itself constitute \u201cdamage\u201d, section 14(4)(a) would be otiose and there would \nbe no material distinction in the remedies available in cases where the data are \ninaccurate and in cases where the data are accurate.

The second reason why the claimant\u2019s interpretation is impossible to reconcile \nwith the language of section 13 is that, as the Court of Appeal recognised in Vidal -Hall, \nit is plain from the words enacted by Parliament the term \u201cdamage\u201d was intended to \nbe limited to material damage and not to extend to \u201cdistress\u201d. The only basis on which \nthe Court of Appeal in Vidal -Hall was able to interpret the term \u201cdamage\u201d as \nencompassing distress was by disapplying section 13(2) as being incompatible with EU law. By the same token, if the term \u201cdamage\u201d in section 13 is to be interpreted as \nhaving an even wider meaning and as encompassing an infringement of a data \nsubjec t\u2019s rights under the Act which causes no material damage nor even distress, that \ncould only be because this result is required by EU law.

It is not suggested in the present case that section 13(1) should be disapplied: \nthe claimant\u2019s case is founded on it. No argument of the kind which succeeded in \nVidal -Hall that words of the statute must be disapplied because they conflict with EU \nlaw is therefore available (or is advanced by the claimant). The question is whether the term \u201cdamage\u201d in section 13(1) can and should be interpreted as having the meaning \nfor which the claimant contends because such an interpretation is required in order to \nmake the domesti c legislation compatible with EU law. There are two aspects of this \nquestion: (i) what does the term \u201cdamage\u201d mean in article 23 of the Data Protection Directive, which section 13 of the DPA 1998 was intended to implement; and (ii) if \n\u201cdamage\u201d in article 23 includes contraventions of the national provisions adopted \npursuant to the Directive which cause no material damage or distress, is it possible to \ninterpret the term \u201cdamage\u201d in section 13(1) of the DPA 1998 as having the same \nmeaning?  \n120. To take the second point first, it does not seem to me possible to interpret the \nterm \u201cdamage\u201d in section 13(1) of the DPA 1998 as having the meaning for which the \nclaimant contends, even if such an interpretation were necessary to make the Act \ncompatible with the Data Prot ection Directive. In Vidal -Hall the Court of Appeal held, \nrightly in my opinion, that section 13 of the DPA 1998 could not be construed as providing a general right to compensation for distress suffered by reason of a \ncontravention of the Act \u201cwithout cont radicting the clearly expressed intention of \nParliament on an issue that was central to the scheme\u201d of the legislation (see para 95 above). The same is equally, if not all the more, true of the contention that section 13 \nof the DPA 1998 can be interpreted as providing a right to compensation for contraventions of the Act which have not caused any distress, let alone material \ndamage. The distinction between \u201cdamage\u201d suffered by an individual and a \n\u201ccontravention\u201d of a requirement of the Act by a data control ler which causes such \ndamage is a fundamental feature of the remedial scheme provided by the Act which, \nas indicated above, permeates section 14 as well as section 13. If it were found that \nthis feature makes the DPA 1998 incompatible with the Data Protect ion Directive, such \nincompatibility could, in my view, only be removed by amending the legislation. That \ncould only be done by Parliament.  \n121. No such incompatibility arises, however, as there is no reason to interpret the \nterm \u201cdamage\u201d in article 23 of the Da ta Protection Directive as extending beyond \nmaterial damage and distress. The wording of article 23 draws exactly the same \ndistinction as section 13(1) of the DPA 1998 between \u201cdamage\u201d and an unlawful act of which the damage is \u201ca result\u201d. Again, this wording identifies the \u201cdamage\u201d for which a \nperson is entitled to receive compensation as distinct from the wrongful act which", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "957297a1-5ed2-4a03-96db-fae327c89518": {"__data__": {"id_": "957297a1-5ed2-4a03-96db-fae327c89518", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "38cfb5ca-0ebd-4a4d-bdd2-60410c93b9f6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "93539eeea33bbfbc85c16248dbb218435e04dc856f6fc69a1ea0eeb0ec4c66c4"}}, "hash": "e93986dbcab0bbeb18ecdca8c675be5cab59513c0ed6958b808156b83fe4c345", "text": "Page 46 \n \n causes the damage. This is inconsistent with giving a right to compensation for the \nunlawful act itself on the basis that the act constitutes an interference with the \nclaimant\u2019s data protection rights. Nor has any authority been cited which suggests that \nthe term \u201cdamage\u201d, either generally in EU law or in the specific context of article 23 of \nthe Data Protection Directive, is to be inte rpreted as including an infringement of a \nlegal right which causes no material damage or distress.  \n122. If there were evidence that at least some national laws on the processing of \npersonal data which pre- dated the Data Protection Directive and are referred to in \nrecital (10), quoted at para 111 above, provided a right to compensation for unlawful processing without proof of material damage or distress, that might arguably support \nan inference that the Directive was intended to ensure a similarly high level of \nprotection across all member states. But it has not been asserted that any national \nlaws did so. The Data Protection Act 1984, which was the applicable UK legislation \nwhen the Data Protection Directive was adopted, in sections 22 and 23 gave the data \nsubjec t an entitlement to compensation in certain circumstances for damage or \ndistress suffered by reason of the inaccuracy of data or the loss or unauthorised destruction or disclosure of data or unauthorised obtaining of access to data. By clear \nimplication, U K national law gave no right to compensation for unlawful processing of \npersonal data which did not result in material damage or distress. There is no evidence \nthat the national law of any other member state at that time did so either.  \n123. EU law therefore does not provide a basis for giving a wider meaning to the \nterm \u201cdamage\u201d in section 13 of the DPA 1998 than was given to that term by the Court \nof Appeal in Vidal -Hall.  \n(c) Flaws in the common source argument \n124. I also reject the claimant\u2019s argument that the decision in Gulati  affords any \nassistance to its case on this issue. Leaving aside the fact that Gulati  was decided many \nyears after the Data Protection Directive was adopted, there is no reason on the face \nof it why the basis on which damages are awarded for an English domestic tort should \nbe regarded as relevant to the proper interpretation of the term \u201cdamage\u201d in a statutory provision intended to implement a European directive. The claimant relies on \nthe fac t that both derive from the right to respect for private life protected by article 8 \nof the Convention (and incorporated in article 7 of the EU Charter when it was created in 2007). It does not follow, however, from the fact that two different legal regimes \naim, at a general level, to provide protection for the same fundamental value that they \nmust do so in the same way or to the same extent or by affording identical remedies. \nThere are significant differences between the nature and scope of the common law \nprivacy tort and the data protection legislation, to which I will draw attention in a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fcd00688-0704-447c-9cac-9e62889d694e": {"__data__": {"id_": "fcd00688-0704-447c-9cac-9e62889d694e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "48f5a0aa-e18b-4202-9956-fbf897b7293c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "e7766bbdb1ee4885787913b90bdcf323a5ac4a12f15868fdd72185b03d8558df"}}, "hash": "6f73350346018eecafcc916a6942eda99a2199fab956b8e43c2a92cfcbdfff88", "text": "Page 47 \n \n moment. But the first point to note is that the decision in Gulati  that damages can be \nawarded for misuse of private information itself was not compelled by article 8 of the \nConvention; nor did article 8 require the adoption of the particular legal framework \ngoverning the protection of personal data contained in the Data Protection Directive \nand the DPA 1998.  \n125. The Convention imposes obligations on the states which are parti es to it, but \nnot on private individuals and bodies. In some cases the obligations on state parties \nextend beyond negative obligations not to act in ways which violate the Convention \nrights and include certain positive obligations on the state to ensure ef fective \nprotection of those rights. That is so as regards the right to respect for private life \nguaranteed by article 8. The European Court of Human Rights has held that in certain \ncircumstances the state\u2019s positive obligations under article 8 are not adequately \nfulfilled unless the state secures respect for private life in the relations between \nindividuals by setting up a legislative framework taking into consideration the various \ninterests to be protected in a particular context. However, the court has em phasised \nthat there are different ways of ensuring respect for private life and that \u201cthe choice of the means calculated to secure compliance with article 8 of the Convention in the \nsphere of the relations of individuals between themselves is in principle a matter that \nfalls within the contracting states\u2019 margin of appreciation\u201d: see the judgment of the \nGrand Chamber in B\u0103rbulescu v Romania [2017] ECHR 754; [2017] IRLR 1032, para 113.  \n126. While the House of Lords in Campbell  drew inspiration from article 8, it did not \nsuggest that the Convention or the Human Rights Act 1998 required the recognition of \na civil claim for damages for misuse of private information in English domestic law, let \nalone that damages should be recoverable in such claim where no material damage or \ndistress has been caused. In Gulati the Court of Appeal rejected an argument that the \napproach to awarding damages for misuse of private information ought to follow the approach of the European Court of Human Rights in making awards of just satisf action \nunder article 41 of the Convention. As Arden LJ observed, at para 89, in awarding damages for misuse of private information, the court is not proceeding under section 8 \nof the Human Rights Act 1998 or article 41 of the Convention, and the conditions  of \nthe tort are governed by English domestic law and not the Convention.  \n127. For those reasons, I do not regard as relevant the decision of the European \nCourt of Human Rights in Halford v United Kingdom (1997) 24 EHRR 523, relied on by \ncounsel for the claimant. In Halford a senior police officer whose telephone calls had been intercepted by her employer in violation of article 8 was awarded \u00a310,000 as just \nsatisfaction.

Even if the award of just \nsatisfaction is understood to have been for the invasion of the right to privacy itself \nrather than for any distress felt by the applicant, however, it does not follow that, in an \naction between private parties under national law for a similar invasion of privacy, the \nConvention requires the court to be able to award damages simply for the loss of \nprivacy itself. \n128. Whilst it may be said that pursuant to the general principles of EU law \nembodied in artic les 7 and 8 of the EU Charter the EU had a positive obligation to \nestablish a legislative framework providing for protection of personal data, there was \nclearly a wide margin of choice as to the particular regime adopted; and the same \napplies to the positi ve obligation imposed directly on the UK by the Convention. It \ncould not seriously be argued that the content of those positive obligations included a requirement to establish a right to receive compensation for any (non- trivial) breach of \nany requirement (in relation to any personal data of which the claimant is the subject) of whatever legislation the EU and UK chose to enact in this area without the need to \nprove that the claimant suffered any material damage or distress as a result of the \nbreach.  \n129. Accord ingly, the fact that the common law privacy tort and the data protection \nlegislation have a common source in article 8 of the Convention does not justify \nreading across the principles governing the award of damages from one regime to the \nother.  \n(d) Material differences between the regimes  \n130. There are further reasons why no such analogy can properly be drawn \nstemming from the differences between the two regimes. It is plain that the detailed scheme for regulating the processing of personal data established by the Data \nProtection Directive extended beyond the scope of article 8 and much more widely \nthan the English domestic tort of misusing private information. An important \ndifference is that the Directive (and the UK national legislation implementing it) \napplied to all \u201cpersonal data\u201d with no requirement that the data are of a confidential or private nature or that there is a reasonable expectation of privacy protection. By \ncontrast, information is protected against misuse by the domestic tort only where \nthere i s a reasonable expectation of privacy. The reasonable expectation of privacy of \nthe communications illicitly intercepted by the defendants in the phone hacking litigation was an essential element of the decision in Gulati that the claimants were \nentitled t o compensation for the commission of the wrong itself.

This point goes to the heart of the approach ado pted by the claimant in the \npresent case. Stripped to its essentials, what the claimant is seeking to do is to claim \nfor each member of the represented class a form of damages the rationale for which \ndepends on there being a violation of privacy, while avo iding the need to show a \nviolation of privacy in the case of any individual member of the class. This is a flawed \nendeavour.  \n132. Another significant difference between the privacy tort and the data protection \nlegislation is that a claimant is entitled to compe nsation for a contravention of the \nlegislation only where the data controller has failed to exercise reasonable care. Some \ncontraventions are inherently fault based. For example, the seventh data protection principle with which a data controller has a duty  to comply pursuant to section 4(4) of \nthe DPA 1998 (and article 17 of the Data Protection Directive) states:  \n\u201cAppropriate technical and organisational measures shall be \ntaken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of \npersonal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data.\u201d  \nA complaint that a data controller has failed to take such \u201cappropriate technical and organisational measures\u201d is similar to an allegation of negligence in that it is \npredicated on failure to meet an objective standard of care rather than on any \nintentional conduct. Even where a contravention of the legislation does not itself \nrequire fault, pursuant to section 13(3), quoted at para 90 above, there is no \nentitlement to compensation if the data contro ller proves that it took \u201csuch care as in \nall the circumstances was reasonably required to comply with the requirement concerned\u201d.  \n133. The privacy tort, like other torts for which damages may be awarded without \nproof of material damage or distress, is a tort i nvolving strict liability for deliberate \nacts, not a tort based on a want of care. No inference can be drawn from the fact that compensation can be awarded for commission of the wrong itself where private \ninformation is misused that the same should be true where the wrong may consist only \nin a failure to take appropriate protective measures and where the right to \ncompensation is expressly excluded if the defendant took reasonable care.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9593e7f4-67ae-4f3e-8fb0-6480d86eb4a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "9593e7f4-67ae-4f3e-8fb0-6480d86eb4a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ad1f72f4-fe7e-4d87-94ae-a60522b6b7ad", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "0cef9684886614f4ee58ddba5b90cd4c1acb7329e8b5c9d6b62f31daba0d42e4"}}, "hash": "8ab58c125960b0b7affae8227b145e2aa18d32a52a3b0235ba3ed05a02778b5f", "text": "Page 50 \n \n 134.

It would be anomalous if failure to take reasonable care t o protect \npersonal data gave rise to a right to compensation without proof that the claimant suffered any material damage or distress when failure to take care to prevent personal \ninjury or damage to tangible moveable property does not.  \n135. Accordingly, I do not accept that the decision in Gulati is applicable by analogy \nto the DPA 1998. To the contrary, there are significant differences between the privacy \ntort and the data protection legislation which make such an analogy positively inappropriate.  \n(e) Equivalence and effectiveness  \n136. I add for completeness that the EU law principles of equivalence and \neffectiveness, on which the Court of Appeal placed some reliance, do not assist the claimant\u2019s case. The principle of equivalence requires that procedural rules governing \nclaims for breaches of EU law rights must not be less favourable than procedural rules \ngoverning equivalent domestic actions. As explained by Lord Briggs, giving the \njudgment of this court, in Totel Ltd v Revenue and Customs Comrs  [2018] UKSC 44; \n[2018] 1 WLR 4053, para 7, the principle is \u201cessentially comparative\u201d. Thus:  \n\u201cThe identification of one or more similar procedures for the \nenforcement of claims arising in domestic law is an essential \nprerequisite for its operation. If there is no true compa rator, \nthen the principle of equivalence can have no operation at all. The identification of one or more true comparators is \ntherefore the essential first step in any examination of an \nassertion that the principle of equivalence has been \ninfringed.\u201d  [citat ion omitted]  \nFor the reasons given, even if the measure of damages is regarded as a procedural \nrule, a claim for damages for misuse of private information at common law is not a \ntrue comparator of a claim under section 13 of the DPA 1998. The principle of \nequivalence can therefore have no operation.  \n137. The principle of effectiveness invalidates a national procedure if it renders the \nenforcement of a right conferred by EU law either virtually impossible or excessively", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e43f7269-348b-46c7-b7ad-b9fb4b74dac0": {"__data__": {"id_": "e43f7269-348b-46c7-b7ad-b9fb4b74dac0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "37e6c5b6-5ba6-49f8-93aa-a14dcff42b74", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "c9c2a89fb70e18c294db68d63f690d963f18d559425cf483b87613379dd2c69b"}}, "hash": "e03c25c7f2a4e29d9b4871884ee08480d053cb5b90fc38216e186c244d2b5bb2", "text": "Page 51 \n \n difficult: see again Totel Ltd at para 7. H owever, the absence of a right to \ncompensation for a breach of data protection rights which causes no material damage \nor distress, even if regarded as a procedural limitation, does not render the \nenforcement of such rights virtually impossible or excessive ly difficult. The right to an \neffective remedy does not require awards of compensation for every (non- trivial) \nbreach of statutory requirements even if no material damage or distress has been \nsuffered.  \n(f) Conclusion on the effect of section 13  \n138. For all the se reasons, I conclude that section 13 of the DPA 1998 cannot \nreasonably be interpreted as conferring on a data subject a right to compensation for \nany (non- trivial) contravention by a data controller of any of the requirements of the \nAct without the need to prove that the contravention has caused material damage or \ndistress to the individual concerned.  \n(9) The claim for user damages  \n139. \u201cUser damages\u201d is the name commonly given to a type of damages readily \nawarded in tort where use has wrongfully been made of someone else\u2019s land or \ntangible moveable property although there has been no financial loss or physical \ndamage to the property. The damages are assessed by estimating what a reasonable \nperson would have paid for the right of user. Damages are also availabl e on a similar \nbasis for patent infringement and other breaches of intellectual property rights. Following the seminal decision of this court in OneStep (Support) Ltd v Morris- Garner  \n[2018] UKSC 20; [2019] AC 649, it is now clear that user damages are compensatory in nature, their purpose being to compensate the claimant for interference with a right to \ncontrol the use of property where the right is a commercially valuable asset. As Lord \nReed explained in Morris- Garner , at para 95(1):  \n\u201cThe rationale of such awards is that the person who makes \nwrongful use of property, where its use is commercially valuable, prevents the owner from exercising a valuable right \nto control its use, and should therefore compensate him for \nthe loss of the value of the exercise of that right. He takes \nsomething for nothing, for which the owner was entitled to \nrequire payment.\u201d", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ffd83e2d-b667-4ae4-8115-ee63324a577d": {"__data__": {"id_": "ffd83e2d-b667-4ae4-8115-ee63324a577d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "18e3c14f-432e-4b91-a31a-7bc79fe88f96", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "2cacaacab7a99b4bb0aa957279d173cd07cfb86f208a4a55813b380deeff0225"}}, "hash": "e48825c98534b5f55126de3ce8597c7839f4650070d3492ae7ac90e1202098ca", "text": "Page 52 \n \n 140. Lord Reed, at paras 27 and 29, cited authorities which make it clear that the \nentitlement to user damages does not depend on whether the owner would in fact \nhave exercised the right to control the use of the property, had it not been interfered \nwith. The \u201closs\u201d for which the claimant is entitled to compensation is not loss of this \n\u201cconventional kind\u201d (para 30); rather, it lies in the wrongful use of the c laimant\u2019s \nproperty itself, for which the economic value of the use provides an appropriate measure. This value can be assessed by postulating a hypothetical negotiation and \nestimating what fee would reasonably have been agreed for releasing the defendant \nfrom the duty which it breached. It is this method of assessment on which the claimant \nrelies in the alternative formulation of the present claim.  \n141. A claim in tort for misuse of private information based on the factual allegations \nmade in this case, such as was made in Vidal -Hall, would naturally lend itself to an \naward of user damages. The decision in Gulati  shows that damages may be awarded \nfor the misuse of private information itself on the basis that, apart from any material \ndamage or distress that it may cause, it prevents the claimant from exercising his or \nher right to control the use of the information. Nor can it be doubted that information \nabout a person\u2019s internet browsing history is a commercially valuable asset. What was \ndescribed by the Chancellor in the Court of Appeal [2020] QB 747, para 46, as \u201cthe \nunderlying reality of this case\u201d is that Google was allegedly able to make a lot of money \nby tracking the browsing history of iPhone users without their consent and selling the \ninformation collected to advertisers.  \n142. The view has sometimes been expressed that asserting privacy in information is \ninconsistent, or at least in tension, with treating such information as a commercial asset: see eg Douglas v Hello! Ltd (No 3)  [2005] EWCA Civ 595; [2006] QB 125, para \n246; and on appeal sub nom OBG Ltd v Allan  [2007] UKHL 21; [2008 ] AC 1, para 275 \n(Lord Walker of  Gestinghorpe). But once the basis of the right to privacy is understood \nto be the protection of a person\u2019s freedom to choose and right to control whether and when others have access to his or her private affairs, I think that any tension largely \ndisappear s. It is common experience that some people are happy to exploit for \ncommercial gain facets of their private lives which others would feel mortified at \nhaving exposed to public view. Save in the most extreme cases, this should be seen as \na matter of personal choice on which it is not for the courts to pass judgments. \nMoreover, where the defendant\u2019s very purpose in wrongfully obtaining and using \nprivate information is to exploit its commercial value, the law should not be prissy \nabout awarding compensation b ased on the commercial value of the exercise of the \nright. As was confirmed in Morris- Garner , the fact that the claimant would not have \nchosen to exercise the right himself is no answer to a claim for user damages.

The point does not arise in the present case, however, because the claimant is \nnot claiming damag es for misuse of private information. As discussed, the only claim \nadvanced is under the DPA 1998. Here it follows from the conclusion reached above \nabout the meaning of section 13 that user damages are not available. This is because, \nfor the reasons given, compensation can only be awarded under section 13 of the DPA \n1998 for material damage or distress caused by an infringement of a claimant\u2019s right to \nhave his or her personal data processed in accordance with the requirements of the \nAct, and not for the i nfringement itself. Although his reasoning was in part based on an \nunderstanding of user damages overtaken by this court\u2019s decision in Morris- Garner , it \nfollows that Patten J was right to hold in Murray v Express Newspapers Plc  [2007] \nEWHC 1908 (Ch); [2007] EMLR 22, at para 92, that the principles on which user \ndamages are awarded do not apply to a claim for compensation under the DPA 1998.  \nF. THE NEED FOR INDIVIDUALISED EVIDENCE OF MISUSE  \n144. There is a further reason why the claimant\u2019s attempt to recover damages under \nsection 13 of the DPA 1998 by means of a representative claim cannot succeed. Even if (contrary to my conclusion) it were unnecessary in order to recover compensation \nunder this provision to show that an individual has suffered material damage or  \ndistress as a result of unlawful processing of his or her personal data, it would still be necessary for this purpose to establish the extent of the unlawful processing in his or \nher individual case. In deciding what amount of damages, if any, should be a warded, \nrelevant factors would include: over what period of time did Google track the \nindividual\u2019s internet browsing history? What quantity of data was unlawfully \nprocessed? Was any of the information unlawfully processed of a sensitive or private \nnature? What use did Google make of the information and what commercial benefit, if \nany, did Google obtain from such use?  \n(1) The claim for the \u201clowest common denominator\u201d  \n145. The claimant does not dispute that the amount of any compensation awarded \nmust in principle depend on such matters. But he contends that it is possible to identify an \u201cirreducible minimum harm\u201d suffered by every member of the class whom \nhe represents for which a \u201cuniform sum\u201d of damages can be awarded. This sum is \nclaimed on the basis that it rep resents what the Chancellor in the Court of Appeal \ndescribed as the \u201clowest common denominator\u201d of all the individual claims: see [2020] \nQB 747, para 75.  \n146.

Mr Lloyd\u2019s answer, which the Court of Appeal accepted, is a \npragmatic one. He points o ut that the limitation period for bringing any proceedings \nhas now expired. For any represented individual there is therefore no longer any realistic possibility of recovering any compensation at all other than through the \npresent action. Furthermore, to m ake this action viable, it is necessary to confine the \namount of damages claimed for each class member to a uniform sum; and a uniform \nsum of damages, even if considerably smaller than an individualised award would be, is \nbetter than nothing.  \n147. I do not thin k it necessary to enter into the merits of this issue. I am prepared to \nassume, without deciding, that as a matter of discretion the court could -  if satisfied \nthat the persons represented would not be prejudiced and with suitable arrangements \nin place enabling them to opt out of the proceedings if they chose -  allow a \nrepresentative claim to be pursued for only a part of the compensation that could potentially be claimed by any given individual. The fundamental problem is that, if no \nindividual circumstanc es are taken into account, the facts alleged are insufficient to \nestablish that any individual member of the represented class is entitled to damages. That is so even if it is unnecessary to prove that the alleged breaches caused any \nmaterial damage or dis tress to the individual.  \n(2) The facts common to each individual case \n148. The facts alleged against Google generically cannot establish that any given \nindividual is entitled to compensation. To establish any such individual entitlement it \nmust be shown, at lea st, that there was unlawful processing by Google of personal \ndata of which that particular individual  was the subject. In considering whether the \nfacts alleged, if proved, are capable of establishing an entitlement to damages, it is \ntherefore necessary to identify what unlawful processing by Google of personal data is \nalleged to have occurred in Mr Lloyd\u2019s own case and also in the case of each other \nmember of the represented class. What facts is the claimant proposing to prove to \nshow that Google acted unlawfully in each individual case?  \n149. The answer, on analysis, is: only those facts which are necessary to show that \nthe individual falls within the definition of the \u201cclaimant class\u201d. The premise of the \nclaim is that Mr Lloyd and each person whom he represents is entitled to damages \nsimply on proof that they are members of the class and without the need to prove any \nfurther facts to show that Google wrongfully collected and used their personal data. \nAny such further facts would inevitably vary from one individua l member of the class \nto another and would require individual proof.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1bd5eb65-3286-4163-9974-113f40a712ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "1bd5eb65-3286-4163-9974-113f40a712ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "326f4b6e-2416-41fc-b7f3-4e0300c173d0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "case.pdf"}, "hash": "5f3c4767456b2533042e7911c08c4b1754837c8546672e35721e3b3c08c38eed"}}, "hash": "d72a0d74dce31f9af29af5c6d33b539921e0ee12f0afa29f8f0817194d3f464e", "text": "Page 55 \n \n 150. To fall within the definition of the class, it must be shown, in substance, that the \nindividual concerned had an iPhone of the appropriate model running a relevant \nversion of the Apple Safari internet browser which, at any date during the relevant \nperiod whilst present in England and Wales, he or she used to access a website that \nwas participating in Google\u2019s DoubleClick advertising service. There are exclusions \nfrom the class definition f or anyone who changed the default settings in the Safari \nbrowser, opted out of tracking and collation via Google\u2019s \u201cAds Preference Manager\u201d or \nobtained a DoubleClick Ad cookie via a \u201cfirst party request\u201d rather than as a \u201cthird \nparty cookie\u201d. The aim of th e definition is to identify all those people who had a \nDoubleClick Ad cookie placed on their device unlawfully, through the Safari workaround, but not to include within the class anyone who did not receive a \nDoubleClick Ad cookie during the relevant period or who received the cookie by lawful \nmeans.  \n151. It is sufficient to bring an individual within the class definition that he or she \nused the Safari browser to access a website participating in Google\u2019s DoubleClick \nadvertising service on a single occasion. The theory is that on that occasion the \nDoubleClick Ad cookie will have been placed on the user\u2019s device unlawfully as a third \nparty cookie. To qualify for membership of the class, it is not necessary to show that \nthe individual ever visited a website particip ating in Google\u2019s DoubleClick advertising \nservice again during the relevant period. Nor is it alleged that any individual or individuals did visit such a website on more than one occasion. The \u201clowest common \ndenominator\u201d on which the claim is based is ther efore someone whose internet usage \n- apart from one visit to a single website -  was not illicitly tracked and collated and who \nreceived no targeted advertisements as a result of receiving a DoubleClick Ad cookie. \nThis is because the claimant has deliberate ly chosen, in order to advance a claim in a \nrepresentative capacity for damages assessed from the bottom up, not to rely on any \nfacts about the internet activity of any individual iPhone user beyond those which \nbring them within the class of represented persons.  \n152. For reasons given earlier, I am leaving aside the difficulties of proving \nmembership of the class, significant as they would appear to be, and am assuming that \nsuch difficulties are not an impediment to the claim. But the question that must be \nasked is whether membership of the represented class is sufficient by itself to entitle \nan individual to compensation, without proof of any further facts particular to that \nindividual.  \n153. On the claimant\u2019s own case there is a threshold of seriousness which must be  \ncrossed before a breach of the DPA 1998 will give rise to an entitlement to \ncompensation under section 13. I cannot see that the facts which the claimant aims to \nprove in each individual case are sufficient to surmount this threshold.

But on analysis the claimant is seeking to recover damages without attempting to prove that this \nallegation is true in the case of any individual for whom damages are claimed. Without \nproof of some unlawful processing of an individual\u2019s personal data beyond the bare \nminimum required to bring them within the definition of the represented class, a claim \non behalf of that individual has no prospect of meeting the threshold for an award of \ndamages.  \n(3) User damages on a lowest common denominator basis  \n154. The claimant\u2019s case is not improved by formulating the claim as one for user \ndamages quantified by estimating what fee each m ember of the represented class \ncould reasonably have charged -  or which would reasonably have been agreed in a \nhypothetical negotiation -  for releasing Google from the duties which it breached. I \nhave already indicated why, in my opinion, user damages cannot be recovered for \nbreaches of the DPA 1998. But even if (contrary to that conclusion) user damages \ncould in principle be recovered, the inability or unwillingness to prove what, if any, \nwrongful use was made by Google of the personal data of any individual again means \nthat any damages awarded would be nil.  \n155. The claimant asserts, and I am content to assume, that if, instead of bypassing \nprivacy settings through the Safari workaround, Google had offered to pay a fee to \neach affected Apple iPhone user for the right to place its DoubleClick Ad cookie on \ntheir device, the fee would have been a standard one, agreed in advance, rather than a fee which varied according to the quantity or commercial value to Google of the \ninformation which was subsequently collected as a result of the user\u2019s acceptance of \nthe cookie. However, imagining the negotiation of a fee in advance in this way is not \nthe correct premise for the valuation.  \n156. As explained in Morris- Garner , the object of an award of user damages is to \ncompensate the claimant for use wrongfully made by the defendant of a valuable asset \nprotected by the right infringed. The starting point for the valuation exercise is thus to \nidentify what the extent of such wrongful use actually was: only then can an estimate \nbe made of what sum of money could reasonably have been charged for that use or, \nput another way, for releasing the wrongdoer from the duties which it breached in the \nwrongful use that it made of the asset.

Applying that approach, the starting point would therefore need to be to \nestablish what unlawful processing by Google of the claimant\u2019s personal data actually \noccurred. Only when the wrongful use actually made by Google of such data is known \nis it possible to estimate its commercial value. As discussed, in order to avoid individual \nassessment, the only wrongful act which the claimant proposes to prove in the case of \neach represented person is that the DoubleClick Ad cookie was unlawfully placed on \ntheir device: no evidence is -  or could without individual assessment -  be adduced to \nshow that, by means of this third party cookie, Google collected or used any personal \ndata relating to that individual. The relevant valuation construct is therefore to ask \nwhat fee would hypothetically have been negotiated for a licence to place the \nDoubleClick Ad cookie on an individual user\u2019s phone as a third party cookie, but \nwithout releasing Google from its obligations not to collect or use any information \nabout that person\u2019s internet browsing history.

The judge took the view  that, even if the legal foundation for the claim made in \nthis action were sound, he should exercise the discretion conferred by CPR rule 19.6(2) by refusing to allow the claim to be continued as a representative action. He \ncharacterised the claim as \u201cofficious litigation, embarked upon on behalf of individuals \nwho have not authorised it\u201d and in which the main beneficiaries of any award of \ndamages would be the funders and the lawyers.

The Court of Appeal formed a very different view \nof the merits of the representative claim. They regarded the fact that the members of the represented class had not authorised the claim as an irrelevant factor, which the \njudge had wrongly taken into account, and considered that it was open to them to \nexercise the discretion afresh. They saw this litigation as the only way of obtaining a \ncivil compensatory remedy for what, if proved, was a \u201cwholesale and deliberate \nmisuse of personal data without consent, undertaken with a view to commercial \nprofit\u201d: see [2020] QB 747, para 86.
